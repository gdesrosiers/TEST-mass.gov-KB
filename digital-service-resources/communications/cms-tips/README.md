# CMS tip of the week

## Week of July 22, 2019

**Moving content to the Trash:** The CMS‚Äôs trash function works much like the recycle \(Windows\) or trash \(Mac\) bins you find on your desktop: You can place items that you don‚Äôt need there to get them out of the way, and you can get them back if it turns out that you shouldn‚Äôt have thrown them out.

## Week of July 15, 2019

**Keep tabs on Topic page feedback:** You might already be reviewing feedback left on the pages you and your colleagues have created, but did you know you can see what people are saying on Topic pages?

**Keep your content fresh:** It‚Äôs a good practice to review your organization's content once every 3-6 months to make sure all the information is still accurate, relevant, and performing well.

This can, in turn, lead to improvements in your content‚Äôs overall performance.

**Check how your content displays on mobile:** 45% of overall Mass.gov traffic comes from tablets or mobile devices. It‚Äôs a good practice to always check how your content looks on mobile devices.

**Keep visitors in mind when linking between Mass.gov and external apps:** When linking to external applications from your Mass.gov pages, be as informative and specific as possible about where your visitors will land.

Instead, link to pages that provide background or contact information.
