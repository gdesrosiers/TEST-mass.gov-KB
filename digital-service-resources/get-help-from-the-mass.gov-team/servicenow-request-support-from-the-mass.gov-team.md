## Communicating with us through ServiceNow

Sometimes, you’ll need to tell us something, answer a question, or clarify your request _after_ you’ve opened a ticket. To do this, click on the “View Ticket Details” button at the bottom of the email or directly reply to the ServiceNow email. You can include attachments just like you would with a normal email to a colleague.![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cAIvT9qFvyHGBf5KJkVGig.png)

You can also access any tickets from the ServiceNow interface. Click “My Tickets” at the top right of the page, and then “view my open tickets.” From this menu, you’ll be able to access and update any ticket you’ve opened.

## Getting answers

When we’ve answered your request, you’ll get an email that says “Requested Item Completed.” Under **closure notes**, you’ll see our answer.

A few important things about our closure notes:

* Sometimes, we think an issue is worth talking about at length, so we’ll suggest that scheduling a content strategy session.
* If you have submitted a ticket about a bug or confusing functionality, we’ll provide you with the internal number we use to keep track of it. It will be a DP-XXXX number. Once we fix it, we’ll use this number to report that we’ve fixed in in [our release notes.](https://edit.mass.gov/admin/release-notes)
* If we’ve reached out to you for more information but haven’t heard back in 2 business days, we’ll send you a message letting you know we are closing your ticket until we hear from you again. You can re-open the ticket by replying to the email or by adding a comment in ServiceNow.

## What we need to answer your support requests

Regardless if you want to ask for new functionality, report a bug, or ask for content strategy, here’s some information that helps us:

* Make sure you include any relevant URLs that you’ve been working on or that you want to work on
* Tell us what you want to do, and why you can’t do it
* If you see an error message, send us the text of that error message
* If something has gone wrong, tell us when you noticed it had gone wrong, and when the last time you edited the content was
* Also, tell us how often a problem happens and whether it’s the first time it has happened to you
* Tell us what kind of browser you use. If you’re not sure, try [https://www.whatsmybrowser.org/](https://www.whatsmybrowser.org/.).
* Lastly, it’s always helpful to include your phone number and one \(or more!\) screenshots of what’s going on
