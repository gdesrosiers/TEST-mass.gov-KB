# Billing organization

## Summary

The **Billing organization** field, found on all [Organization pages](), is an additional method of telling the CMS which organization owns which pieces of content. Like the [Organization\(s\) field](), this field makes sure we're collecting all the data from all of your organization's associated content while also ensuring you're organization is being billed appropriately.

## How to bill an organization

When creating an [Organization page](), you will be required to select an organization in the **Billing organization** field under the More tab.

The organization you select will establish the relationship between this **Billing organization** field and the [**Organization\(s\)** field]() found on the Title banner tab. Now, each piece of content where you've added this particular Organization as the first entry in the **Organization\(s\)** field will also be associated with this billing customer group. 

Select your organization from the drop-down menu. You will see the billing customer group and billing code is listed alphabetically in the following format: "Group Name \(000-000\)".  

## Important to know about the billing organization field

* You may only select 1 organization from the **Billing organization** field drop-down
* If all your content, Organization page included, must be billed to a parent organization, select the parent organization in the **Billing organization** field
  * For example, if all of the Department of Public Health \(DPH\)'s content should be billed to the Executive Office of Health and Human Services \(EOHHS\),  select EOHHS from the **Billing organization** drop-down on the DPH Organization page.
* If you aren't sure of your organization's billing group, please contact your finance department or submit a [ServiceNow request](https://massgov.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0bb8e784dbec0700f132fb37bf9619fe) for further assistance.
