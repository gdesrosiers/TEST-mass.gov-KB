# Contacting authors in the CMS

## **Summary**

There are many instances where you might want to reach out to a fellow author about their content. Maybe you’ve stumbled upon a broken link, maybe you share similar information and would like to collaborate, or maybe they’ve organized their content in such a way that you’d like to learn more about what they did. Whatever the reason, it’s easy to contact any author without ever leaving the Mass.gov content management system \(CMS\) with the “Contact the author” tool.

## **Sending an email to a fellow author**

### **Step 1: Find the author**

There are 2 ways to find the author you need to contact. You’ll either find them on the “New Draft” screen or the Revision Log.

#### **New \(or Edit\) Draft**

When on the New Draft screen \(it will be titled Edit Draft if the content has not yet been published\), you’ll find information about the original author on the right side of the page. This is the author that created this content, but not necessarily the last one to make edits.

#### **Revision Log**

To see who made the most recent revisions to the content, check the Revision Log by clicking the “Revisions’ tab.

### **Step 2: Open the contact tool**

Once you’ve identified the author you’d like to contact, it’s time to send them an email.

From the New Draft screen, click the “Contact the author” link next to the username:

From the Revision Log, click the `CONTACT THIS AUTHOR` button below the username:

### **Step 3: Draft your message**

Once you’ve opened the contact tool, some of the fields will be pre-filled with information pulled from the CMS, including:

* Your username
* Your email address
* The username of the author you’re contacting
* A generic subject line with reference to the page title and node ID of the page you’re reaching out about

Now you can fill out the message field that will make up the body of your email.

You can choose to send a copy of the email to yourself by checking the box below the message field.

After sending the message, you’ll be taken to the user profile of the author you just messaged and see a green confirmation banner at the top of the screen:

## **Receiving an email from a fellow author**

Here’s what the email will look like in the other author’s inbox:

If you’re on the receiving end of this email, you can reply to the author by emailing them at the listed email address. If you reply to the original email, the author won’t see your response.
