# Stages of content moderation when editing a page

## Summary

When you're editing a page in the CMS, you'll need to set the moderation state in order to save your edits. The table below provides an overview of the various options and whether or not your edits will be visible to the public. 

| Current State |  | Changed to State | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Published  | ➜ | Draft | The original page will remain published. Only the draft will be unpublished. |
| Draft  | ➜ | Needs Review | Unpublished. Your page must be a draft in order to put it in Needs Review. |
| Needs Review  | ➜ | Published | Published |
| Draft  | ➜ | Published | Published |
| Published  | ➜ | Unpublished | Unpublished |
| Any state  | ➜ | Trash | Unpublished |

## Draft

When editing an existing page, whether it is published or unpublished, you can select **Change to: Draft** in the drop-down at the bottom of the page and then click save. ****This will create a draft for you while keeping the the page either published or unpublished as it was before.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you're making edits to a published page that require review, there's a 2-step process form moving that content to **Needs review**. You'll first need to select **Change to: Draft**. Once your page is in a draft, you can go in and select **Save as: Needs Review**. 
{% endhint %}

## Publish

If you want the changes you have made to a page to be published, select **Change to: Published** in the drop-down at the bottom of the page and then click save. This will publish the changes that you made, merging your edits with the published version.

## Unpublish

If you want to unpublish a page, select **Change to: Unpublished** in the drop-down at the bottom of the page and then click save. If you made edits to the page prior to selecting **Change to: Unpublished**, those edits will also be saved in the unpublished version.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note, selecting **Change to: Unpublished** does _not_ only unpublish the edits you have made on an existing page, it unpublishes the entire page. 
{% endhint %}

## Trash

If you want content to be moved to the trash, select **Change to: Trash** in the drop-down at the bottom of the page and then click save.
