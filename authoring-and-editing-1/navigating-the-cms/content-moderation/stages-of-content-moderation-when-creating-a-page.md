# Stages of content moderation when creating a page

## Summary

When you're creating a new page in the CMS, you can either save it as a draft, publish it, put it in the trash, or put it in needs review.

| Publishing state | Status |
| :---: | :---: |
| Draft | Unpublished |
| Needs Review | Unpublished |
| Trash | Unpublished |
| Published | Published |

## Draft

To create an unpublished draft from the new page you have created, select **Save as: Draft** in the drop-down at the bottom of the page, and then click save.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since this is a new page that you have created, when you save it as a draft, it is automatically unpublished. 
{% endhint %}

## Needs review

If you want your new page to be reviewed by an editor, select **Save as: Needs review** in the drop-down at the bottom of the page, and then click save. This will create an unpublished draft of your new page and place it in the needs review list.

## Trash

The [trash function]() works a lot like the recycle bin on your computer: You can place items that you don’t need there to get them out of the way, and you can get them back if it turns out that you shouldn’t have thrown them out.

## Publish

If you want the new page you have created to be visible to the public, select **Save as: Published** in the drop-down at the bottom of the page and then click save.
