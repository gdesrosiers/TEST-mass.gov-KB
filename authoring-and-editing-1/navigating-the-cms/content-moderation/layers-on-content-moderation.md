# Layers on content moderation

## Summary

Understanding content moderation is important because it allows you to control who sees your content when making changes in the CMS.

## Layers of content moderation

There are 2 layers of content moderation. Understanding these layers will help you further understand how content moves through the publishing process in the CMS.

### First layer of content moderation

The first layer is the foundation layer of content moderation. This layer is essentially the "on" and "off" switch of content, meaning you can either publish or unpublish your content. 

### Second layer of content moderation

The second layer is how you can make changes to content that is already published without unpublishing the content. Here you can create a new draft, move content to the trash, or send content to be reviewed.

When you create a draft of content that is published, the draft sits on top of the published version. Any changes made to the draft won't affect the published version \(until you decide to publish it\). Since the draft and the published versions behave like 2 separate pages, you're able to edit the draft version without changing the published version.
