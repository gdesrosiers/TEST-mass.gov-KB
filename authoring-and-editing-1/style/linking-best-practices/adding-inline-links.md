# Adding inline links

## ‌Before you start

‌

If content already exists on Mass.gov, it's best to link to that content rather than recreate a similar version. This helps make sure that content is always up to date since it's the single source of truth. It also helps the content's Search Engine Optimization \(SEO\) since it's not competing with similar pages.

If the content is owned by another author, [try reaching out to them](https://app.gitbook.com/@massgovdigital/s/knowledge-base/~/drafts/-LlDIMokOLPlXiiLs5DS/primary/authoring-and-editing-1/navigating-the-cms/contacting-authors-within-the-cms) if you need information updated or revised.‌

## Overview <a id="overview"></a>

‌

You can add inline links within any [rich text editor](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/authoring-and-editing/editing-toolbar) while creating or editing content on Mass.gov.![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dGSEh4n5VAip92VGQlDxFV1lwFGudnwX49_oAhq4zCiw706agH_axANMwAWt5IHJ1WnThch4LlzdvpgXyNWXDGsW1ppTV_gFSDJVH-EHTn6U5Ja9pnLlcJpncZ15ehVYWGQ0t4na)‌

Inline links have 2 parts: the anchor text, or words that can be clicked; and the URL, or web address, that those words link to.

**Note:** This resource is about linking to HTML content. Check out our [Linking to documents article](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/authoring-and-editing/documents/linking-to-documents) for more info about working with documents and other types of files.‌

## **Choosing anchor text for your link** <a id="choosing-anchor-text-for-your-link"></a>

‌

Good anchor text is an important part of accessibility and searchability. Avoid using “click here” or other non-specific language. Instead, try to explain where you’ll go if you click the link, matching the title of the destination page if possible.‌

_Example:_

> ​[SNAP benefits](https://www.mass.gov/snap-benefits-formerly-known-as-food-stamps), formerly the food stamps program, are part of a federal program to help people with limited means pay for food. You can [find out if you are eligible for SNAP benefits online](https://dtaconnect.eohhs.mass.gov/screening) or by calling the [Department of Transitional Assistance’s \(DTA\)](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-transitional-assistance) helpline at \(877\) 382–2363.
