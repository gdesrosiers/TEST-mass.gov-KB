# Location Detail checklist

## Findability

* Use keywords in the page **Title**, **Short Description**, and high up on the page. Think of the search terms your users would use.
* Search for your page’s **Title** on Mass.gov to make sure your title is distinguishable from other content.
* Link to this page on at least 1 Location Page. If the Location Detail page is related to an activity that can be done at a park, link to it in the Location Page’s **Activities** section. If related to a general location, link to it inline \(where appropriate\) and in the related links.
* Make sure related pages link to this page, and that those links are written in language visitors would use.

## Outcomes

* [Make sure documents are linked correctly.](../../../files-or-media/documents/)
* If you link to an application or website off Mass.gov, explain what users can do at the off-site application or website.

## Content Quality

* Write the **Title** in sentence case \(only capitalize the first letter and proper nouns\).
* Do the **Title** and **Short Description** work together? Write them so that the title states plainly what the page is about and the short description says what you can do.
* Spell out acronyms the first time you use them.
* [Check your content’s grade level using Siteimprove](../../../content-improvement-tools/siteimprove/check-your-contents-readability-with-siteimprove.md). Work toward Grade 8 or below. If you don’t have access to Siteimprove, [open a service request in ServiceNow](../../../digital-service-resources/get-help-from-the-mass.gov-team/servicenow-request-support-from-the-mass.gov-team.md) to request an account.
* If grade level is above 8, user simpler sentences, smaller words, fewer adjectives and adverbs, and eliminate technical terms.
* [Use Siteimprove to check for broken links and fix them](../../../content-improvement-tools/siteimprove/use-siteimprove-to-fix-broken-links.md).
* [Make sure link text is accessible](../style-guide/#links): Read aloud to see if users can tell from the text alone where the link takes them.
* Look at your content on a mobile phone. Check that it displays correctly and that all the links work.
* Is a Location Detail the right content type? Keep this page focused on a specific activity or piece of information available at this location.
* If it’s about generalized information, maybe it should be a [Service Detail](../../../content-types-1/services-and-info/service-detail.md).
* If it’s mostly links, maybe it should be a [Curated List](../../../content-types-1/services-and-info/curated-lists/).
* If it’s very long, maybe it should be multiple Service Detail pages or an [Info Detail](../../../content-types-1/services-and-info/information-details.md) page.
* If its title begins with a verb, maybe it should be a [How-to](../../../content-types-1/services-and-info/how-to-pages.md).
* If it’s describing a complicated process, maybe it should be a [Guide](../../../content-types-1/services-and-info/guides.md).
* Here are some suggestions for [how to convert a page from one content type to another](../../strategy/converting-from-1-content-type-to-another.md).

## User Satisfaction

* Review comments left by users in the [Feedback](../../../content-improvement-tools/feedback-manager.md) tab, located on the “Content” toolbar.
* Look for references on the page to other content you’ve authored, and change those references to inline links.
* Fill out the **Related Links** section based on trends in user feedback.
* Add or clarify content based on trends in user feedback.
