# Location checklist

## Findability

* The **Title** should be a clear and complete name for your location. Try to keep titles short and avoid abbreviations Use acronyms only when they are familiar to the public \(e.g. “RMV”\).
* Use keywords in the page **Overview**. Think of the search terms your users would use.
* Search for your location’s **Title** on Mass.gov to make sure your title is distinguishable from other content.
* Link this page to at least 1 Service or Organization page in the **Map**section.
* Make sure related pages link to this page. This will usually include the **Related Locations** section on other Location pages or the **In Person**method on How-To pages.

## Outcomes

* Write the **Short Description** so that it tells users what they can do on the page.
* Add key links to the **Quick Actions** section.
* If this is a park, make sure to include downloadable trail maps.
* Make sure the **Primary Location** section includes the physical address and correct contact information for your location.
* [Make sure documents are linked correctly.](../../../files-or-media/documents/)

## Content Quality

* Make sure your **Overview** offers a high-level description of what can be done at your location.
* For parks, include any interesting facts that will grab users’ attention.
* Avoid acronyms when possible. Spell them out the first time you use them.
* [Check your content’s grade level using Siteimprove](../../../content-improvement-tools/siteimprove/check-your-contents-readability-with-siteimprove.md). Work toward grade 8 or below. If you don’t have access to Siteimprove, [open a service request in ServiceNow](../../../digital-service-resources/get-help-from-the-mass.gov-team/servicenow-request-support-from-the-mass.gov-team.md) to ask for an account.
* If grade level is above 8, user simpler sentences, smaller words, fewer adjectives and adverbs, and eliminate technical terms.
* [Use Siteimprove to check for broken links and fix them](../../../content-improvement-tools/siteimprove/use-siteimprove-to-fix-broken-links.md).
* [Make sure link text is accessible](../style-guide/#links): Read it aloud to see if users can tell from the text alone where the link takes them.
* Look at your content on a mobile phone. Check that it displays correctly and that all the links work.
* If there’s lengthy, very specific information about your location, such as an activity you can do at a park or what you need to know before arriving at a courthouse, consider moving some information to a Location Detail page.

## User Satisfaction

* List accurate **Parking** and **Hours** information.
* If there’s a fee for parking, be sure to include that as well.
* If there’s no onsite parking, list alternatives, such as street or metered parking.
* List all information about **Activities**, **Facilities**, **Restrictions**, **Accessibility**, and **Services** at your location, linking to Location Detail pages as needed.
* Look for references on the page to other content you’ve authored, and change those references to inline links.
* Fill out the **Quick Actions** section based on trends in user feedback.
* Add or clarify content based on trends in user feedback.
