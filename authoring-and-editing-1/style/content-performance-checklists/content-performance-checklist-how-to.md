# How-to checklist

## Findability

* Use keywords in the page **Title**, **Short Description**, and high up on the page. Think of the search terms your users would use.
* Search for your page’s **Title** on Mass.gov to make sure your title is distinguishable from other content.
* Link this page to at least 1 Service Page in the **Tasks** or **Featured** sections.
* Make sure related pages link to this page, and that those links are written in language visitors would use.

## Outcomes

* Make sure your **Action Type** verb is the verb your users would use.
* Write the **Short Description** so that it tells users what they can do on the page.
* Add key links to the **Quick Actions** section.
* Duplicate **Quick Action** links in rich text in the right **Methods** section, e.g. “Online,” “In person” etc..
* If relevant, fill out the **Fee Information** field.
* In the **Methods** section, “online” should contain a link, “in person” an address, “phone” a phone number, and/or “fax” a fax number.
* Fill out the **Contacts** section.
* If this How-to links to an application off Mass.gov, explain what users can do at the off-site application.
* [Make sure documents are linked correctly.](../../../files-or-media/documents/)
* Is this page addressing multiple audiences? It might be better off as 2 pages \(e.g. 1 for businesses and 1 for individuals\).

## Content Quality

* Write the **Title** in sentence case \(only capitalize the first letter and proper nouns\).
* The **Title** should begin with an action verb \(apply, buy, renew, request, etc.\) Make sure this is the same as the **Action Type** verb.
* Do the **Title** and **Short Description** work together? Write them so that the title states plainly what the page is about and the short description says what you can do.
* Spell out acronyms the first time you use them.
* [Check your content’s grade level using Siteimprove](../../../content-improvement-tools/siteimprove/check-your-contents-readability-with-siteimprove.md). Work toward grade 8 or below. If you don’t have access to Siteimprove, [open a service request in ServiceNow](../../../digital-service-resources/get-help-from-the-mass.gov-team/servicenow-request-support-from-the-mass.gov-team.md) to ask for an account.
* If grade level is above 8, user simpler sentences, smaller words, fewer adjectives and adverbs, and eliminate technical terms.
* [Use Siteimprove to check for broken links and fix them](../../../content-improvement-tools/siteimprove/use-siteimprove-to-fix-broken-links.md).
* [Make sure link text is accessible](../style-guide/#links): Read it aloud to see if users can tell from the text alone where the link takes them.
* Look at your content on a mobile phone. Check that it displays correctly and that all the links work.
* If you need to add multiple sections of content, consider moving some information to a Service Detail page about eligibility.

## User Satisfaction

* Look for references on the page to other content you’ve authored, and change those references to inline links.
* If users might need to find a location, link to a Location Listing in the “In person” section.
* Fill out the **Related Links** section based on trends in user feedback.
* Add or clarify content based on trends in user feedback.
