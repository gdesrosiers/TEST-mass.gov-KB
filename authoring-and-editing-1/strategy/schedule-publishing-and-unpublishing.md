# Schedule publishing and unpublishing

## Summary

This resource will show you how to schedule content \(both HTML pages and documents\) to automatically publish or unpublish. This is especially useful if you know that your content is only relevant for a specific period of time. Telling the CMS to unpublish content once it is no longer useful will keep the site from becoming cluttered with out-of-date information.

Scheduling content is deceptively powerful. It may require a little thoughtwork ahead of time. You can do all of these:

* Schedule a date for new content to publish
* Schedule a date for new content to unpublish
* Schedule _both_ dates
* Schedule a time for a new draft of existing content to publish
* Schedule a time for existing content to unpublish
* Schedule a time for a new draft of existing content to publish, and then to unpublish \(the end result here is the same as just unpublishing a page\)

Any HTML content you schedule will appear in the new “Scheduled: publish” and “Scheduled: unpublish” tabs on the “All Content” screen.

Any documents you schedule will appear in the new "Scheduled: publish" and "Scheduled: unpublish" tabs in the "All Documents" screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Scheduling of a _document_ and of a _page_ are 2 separate things: If you have a page that links to a document, and the page is scheduled for tomorrow, and your intent is for the document to also become available tomorrow when the page publishes, you need to schedule the 2 things individually.
{% endhint %}

### **Step 1: Open the scheduling options view**

You’ll find a dropdown called **scheduling options** in the gray box on the right side of the editing interface. \(It doesn’t matter what content type you’re working in — the gray box is always in the same place.\) Click the arrow to open it.

### **Step 2: Schedule your content**

Use the calendar tool to tell the CMS when to publish or unpublish your page. Use the up and down arrow keys to adjust the date and time. Also, don’t forget to choose a.m. or p.m.

### **Step 3: Save your changes**

#### **If you are scheduling publication…**

You should “save and create new draft.” **Important:** if you “save and publish,” your page will publish immediately.

To schedule content for publishing, “Save and Create New Draft”

#### **If you are only scheduling a date to unpublish…**

You can save and publish as usual. On the date and time you’ve listed, the CMS will unpublish your page.

If you only want to schedule unpublishing, use “Save and Publish.”

## Scheduling and existing content

The steps above also apply to existing content. However, it’s important to remember that a _published_ page and a _draft_ \(a new version of that page\) can exist at the same time. If you create a new draft of an existing page, add a scheduled publication date, and “save as draft,” then your existing content will update \(i.e. the new draft will be automatically published\) at the time and day you’ve specified.

If you decide you want to schedule a date to unpublish content after it’s already been published, you would open the page in “edit” mode, add an “unpublish date,” and then “save and publish.”

#### **An illustrative example**

Let’s say your organization holds an annual contest where it awards prizes for the best photo of black-capped chickadees. You announce the new winners at 10 p.m., December 31st, each year. You currently have last year’s winners published in a Service Detail, but you already know who this year’s winners will be. You create a new draft of your Service Detail winners page, tell the CMS to publish it on December 31st at 10 pm., and “save as draft.”

In this scenario, last year’s contest winners would be published until 9:59 p.m., December 31st. Then, last year’s content would be automatically replaced with this year’s content.

Later, your organization decides that it does not want this content to be published for a full year because, after 6 months, constituents begin asking when the new results will be announced. To schedule your contest winners content to unpublish in June, you open your Service Detail in “edit” mode, and in **scheduling options,** you tell the CMS to unpublish your content on June 1 at 10 p.m. Then, you “save and publish.” On June 1, your Service Detail will be automatically unpublished.

Come December, if you decide you want to generate excitement for this year’s content, you might choose to re-publish the winners from last year, and then repeat the procedure above to add the new winners to a new draft \(which you could schedule to publish at 10 p.m. December 31 again\).
