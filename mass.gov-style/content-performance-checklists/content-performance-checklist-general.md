# General checklist

## Findability

* Use keywords in the page **Title**, **Short Description**, and high up on the page. Think of the search terms your users would use.
* Search for your page’s **Title** on Mass.gov to make sure your title is distinguishable from other content.
* Make sure your page has at least 1 Relationship Indicator showing it’s connected to a Topic or Service page. A Relationship Indicator is the small, rectangular breadcrumb at the top of the page after the words “More about.” Link your page in the appropriate autocomplete field on a Service page to generate a Relationship Indicator.
* Make sure related pages link to this page, and that those links are written in language visitors would use.

## Outcomes

* [Make sure documents are linked correctly.](../../authoring-and-editing/documents/)
* Is this page addressing multiple audiences? It might be better off as multiple pages \(e.g. one for businesses and one for individuals\).
* Write the **Short Description** or **Overview** \(if it has one\) ****so that they tell users what they can do or find on the page.
* Add key links to the **Quick Actions** or **Key Actions** sections if applicable.
* Fill out the **Contacts** and **Offered By** sections \(if it has them\).
* If you link to an application or website off Mass.gov, explain what users can do at the off-site application or website.

## Content Quality

* Write the **Title** in sentence case \(only capitalize the first letter and proper nouns\).
* Do the **Title**, **Short Description**, and **Overview** \(if it has one\) work together? The title should state plainly what the page is about. The short description and overview should give more detail on what you can do or find on that page. Avoid repeating the same information in each field.
* Spell out acronyms the first time you use them.
* [Check your content’s grade level using Siteimprove](../../tools-for-improving-your-content/siteimprove/check-your-contents-readability-with-siteimprove.md). Work toward Grade 8 or below. If you don’t have access to Siteimprove, [open a Service Request in ServiceNow](../../get-help-from-the-mass.gov-team/servicenow-request-support-from-the-mass.gov-team.md) to request it.
* If grade level is above 8, use simpler sentences, smaller words, fewer adjectives and adverbs, and eliminate technical terms.
* [Use Siteimprove to check for broken links and fix them](../../tools-for-improving-your-content/siteimprove/use-siteimprove-to-fix-broken-links.md).
* [Make sure link text is accessible](../style-guide.md#links): Read aloud to see if users can tell from the text alone where the link takes them.
* Look at your content on a mobile phone. Check that it displays correctly and that all the links work.
* Are you using the right content type?
* If it’s mostly links, maybe it should be a [Curated List](../../content-types/curated-lists/).
* If it’s very long, maybe it should be multiple Service Detail pages or an [Info Details](../../content-types/information-details.md) page.
* If its title begins with a verb, maybe it should be a [How-To](../../content-types/how-to-pages.md).
* If it’s describing a complicated process, maybe it should be a [Guide](../../content-types/guides.md).
* If it’s linking to more than 12 Service Detail and How-To pages, maybe it should be a [Service](../../content-types/service-page.md).
* If it’s linking to several Service pages that share a general theme, maybe it should be a [Topic](../../content-types/topic-pages/about-topic-pages.md) page.
* If you’re not sure, try the [Choosing the correct content type](https://www.mass.gov/decision-tree/choosing-the-correct-content-type-on-massgov) Decision Tree.
* Here are some suggestions for [how to convert a page from one content type to another](../converting-from-1-content-type-to-another.md).

## User Satisfaction

* Review comments left by users in the [Feedback](../../tools-for-improving-your-content/feedback-manager.md) tab, located on the “Content” toolbar.
* Look for references on the page to other content you’ve authored, and change those references to inline links.
* If users might need to find a location, link to a Location Listing where appropriate.
* Fill out the **Related Links** section based on trends in user feedback.
* Add or clarify content based on trends in user feedback.
