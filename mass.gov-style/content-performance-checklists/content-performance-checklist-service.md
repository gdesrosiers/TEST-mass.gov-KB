# Service checklist

## Findability

* Use keywords in the page **Title**, **Short Description**, and **Overview**. Think of the search terms your users would use.
* Search for your page’s **Title** on Mass.gov to make sure your title is distinguishable from other content.
* Link How-tos in **Tasks** and Service Details/Guides/Lists in **What you need to know.**
* Link this page to at least 1 Topic Page. If it’s not, [open a service request in ServiceNow](../../get-help-from-the-mass.gov-team/servicenow-request-support-from-the-mass.gov-team.md) and ask to have it linked.
* Make sure related pages link to this page, and that those links are written in language visitors would use.
* Does this page have more than 12 links in the **Tasks** and **What you need to know** sections? Consider if it should be 2 service pages.

## Outcomes

* Use the **Short Description** and **Overview** to say what users can do on the page. This might be a summary of what the links lead to.
* Add your most popular/important pages to **Featured tasks.**
* [Make sure documents are linked correctly.](../style-guide.md#links)
* If you have locations the public can visit, create Location pages and link to them under the Map tab.
* Is this page addressing multiple audiences? It might be better off as 2 Service pages \(e.g. one for businesses and one for individuals\).

## Content Quality

* Write the **Title** in title case \(capitalizing nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs\).
* Do the **Title** and **Short Description** work together? Write them so that the title states plainly what the page is about and the short description says what you can do.
* Spell out acronyms the first time you use them.
* [Check your content’s grade level using Siteimprove](../../tools-for-improving-your-content/siteimprove/check-your-contents-readability-with-siteimprove.md). Work toward Grade 8 or below. If you don’t have access to Siteimprove, [open a service request in ServiceNow](../../get-help-from-the-mass.gov-team/servicenow-request-support-from-the-mass.gov-team.md) to ask for an account..
* If grade level is above 8, user simpler sentences, smaller words, fewer adjectives and adverbs, and eliminate technical terms.
* [Use Siteimprove to check for broken links and fix them](../../tools-for-improving-your-content/siteimprove/use-siteimprove-to-fix-broken-links.md).
* [Make sure link text is accessible](../style-guide.md#links): Read aloud to see if users can tell from the text alone where the link takes them.
* Look at your content on a mobile phone. Check that it displays correctly and that all the links work.

## User Satisfaction

* Fill out the **Offered by** field with your organization and the **Contact Information** field with Contact Information.
* Fill out the **Related Services** section based on trends in user feedback.
* Add or clarify content based on trends in user feedback.
* If this is a complicated service, make a first-time guide and/or an eligibility information Service Detail page.
