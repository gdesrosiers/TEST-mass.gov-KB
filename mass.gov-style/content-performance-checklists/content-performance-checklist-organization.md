# Organization checklist

## Findability

* Fill out the **Who We Serve** field in the Overview section. This is a place to include keywords and phrases people might use to search for your organization.
* If your organization has social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube, add them to the **Social Links** field under the Overview section.
* Is your org page included in our [A-Z listing of organizations](https://www.mass.gov/state-a-to-z)? If it’s not, [open a service request in ServiceNow](../../get-help-from-the-mass.gov-team/servicenow-request-support-from-the-mass.gov-team.md) and ask to have it linked.
* Is your org page listed in the appropriate Topic page under the [Your Government Topic in the main navigation](https://www.mass.gov/topics/your-government). If it’s not, [open a service request in ServiceNow](../../get-help-from-the-mass.gov-team/servicenow-request-support-from-the-mass.gov-team.md) and ask to have it linked.

## Outcomes

* Highlight up to 3 Service Pages under **Featured Services**. Your most popular, most important, or newest services are good candidates for this area.
* Add News items by listing your Organization as a **Signee** when creating a News item. Make sure to update your **Featured News Items** regularly so users are getting the most up-to-date information about your organization.
* Add Events by including your Organization as an **Associated Page** when creating the Event.
* Create Location pages for your organization if constituents can visit your offices. Link to them on your Organization page to create a map and a locations listing page.
* Add **Featured Topics** under the More section. You can link to existing Topic pages in the site’s main navigation. Or, you can [open a service request in ServiceNow](../../get-help-from-the-mass.gov-team/servicenow-request-support-from-the-mass.gov-team.md) to ask for a topic page specifically for your Organization page.
* List your Organization in the **Offered By** field of all your Service Pages.

## Content quality

* Spell out acronyms the first time you use them.
* [Check your content’s grade level using Siteimprove](../../tools-for-improving-your-content/siteimprove/check-your-contents-readability-with-siteimprove.md). Work toward Grade 8 or below. If you don’t have access to Siteimprove, [open a service request in ServiceNow](../../get-help-from-the-mass.gov-team/servicenow-request-support-from-the-mass.gov-team.md) and ask for an account.
* If grade level is above 8, user simpler sentences, smaller words, fewer adjectives and adverbs, and eliminate technical terms.
* [Use Siteimprove to check for broken links and fix them](../../tools-for-improving-your-content/siteimprove/use-siteimprove-to-fix-broken-links.md).
* Look at your content on a mobile phone. Check that it displays correctly and that all the links work.

## User Satisfaction

* Fill out the **Primary Contact information** field.
* Fill in **Related Organizations** with organizations that provide similar services or offer information your visitors may be looking for.
* Add or clarify content based on trends in user feedback.
