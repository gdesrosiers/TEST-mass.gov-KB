# Identifying services: Tips

We know switching to constituent-first content can be confusing. We’ve gathered some tips to help you identify your organization’s services.

### What is a service?

First, ask, “What do people come to us for?”

If there’s a clear, concise answer, you’ve got a service! \(Hint: Most organizations have a number of services, so there can be more than 1 answer to this question.\)

If there isn’t, we’ve put together some characteristics that may help you identify your organization’s services. A service:

* Is something the government provides to constituents \(private citizens, businesses, or both\)
* Is most often transaction-based \(unemployment benefits\), but can be information-based \(flu information\)
* Is a collection of diverse actions or interactions \(like “Apply,” “Request,” “Cancel,” all of which will become individual pages\)
* Can include cases where constituents have to provide information to the government \(for instance, filing taxes\)
* Is usually managed by 1 organization \(but not always\)
* Usually has only 1 application process \(see below for troubleshooting tips\)

Here are some additional characteristics that are important to note:

* The name of a service should be a term that constituents use, rather than what people in government call it \(for example, “Quitting smoking” instead of “Tobacco cessation”\)
* Constituents’ relationship to the service may change over time \(for instance, “renew” or “manage” is part of the same service a constituent would initially apply for\)

Each service that your organization offers will get its own service page, which is a one-stop shop where constituents can find everything they need to get something done. From there, they can find background information to help them complete an application, claim a tax credit, or simply figure out if they qualify for your program. They’ll also find how-to pages that tell them exactly how to accomplish every distinct task related to your service, allowing them to focus directly on the action or step they need at that moment.

### **What if there’s more than 1 way to apply for my service?**

Ask yourself these questions:

* Are the 2 ways to apply meaningfully different? \(For example, are there different steps for one process versus another, or a different application altogether?\)
* Is there different supporting information associated with the ways to apply? \(For example, different detailed requirements that 1 group must meet.\)
* Do they target 2 or more audiences that don’t have any interaction with or aren’t aware of each other? \(For example, if the same form could be used to apply for a license to be a barber or a dog catcher.\)

If you answered yes to any of these questions, you likely have **2 services**, not 1 service with 2 How-to pages about applying.
