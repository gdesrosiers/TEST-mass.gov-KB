# Editorial must-haves list

To ensure that your pages are linked in the new Mass.gov navigation, please make sure that all of your content conforms to our editorial must-haves list. Please note that we also reserve the right to make the editorial changes listed below.

### **CMS**

#### **Correct content types are used**

* Ex.: The page “Download a file” shouldn’t be a service page

####  **Correct page components are used**

* Ex.: On a service page, the “What would you like to do” area should only have buttons to how-to pages

#### **Has all “required” fields**

* Required fields filled in according to help text

#### **No broken links, in other words links that don’t work**

* After publishing, check links on page on www.mass.gov \(not edit.mass.gov\)

### **Organization page**

**Do not put names of elected officials in title**

* Ex: Attorney General’s Office \(AGO\), not Attorney General Maura Healey’s Office

#### **Short description**

* 1–2 complete sentences maximum with periods
* Don’t use exclamation marks

#### **Who we serve**

* 3–5 sentence max
* Don’t use numbered lists

### Service Pages

#### **Title**

* Title is title case, meaning the first letter of each word is capitalized. Don’t capitalize words like and, or, by, of. Ex.: Unemployment Benefits
* Title should clearly describe the service in constituent-friendly language
* Title should stand alone. Remember, a user may come to this page through a Google search.
* Avoid organization name in service page titles
* Service page titles are generally nouns. Don’t use verbs like “apply,” “start,” or “take” in a service page title

#### **Content**

* A service is a collection of actions and information all related to a product or offering the state provides to constituents.  Ex.: “About X Board” is not a service. It could be a service detail page on a service page about a service the board offers.  Ex.: “Board Meetings and Agendas” is not a service. Meetings are events on an organization page.
* Overview is concise, explaining who the service is for and what it provides. Don’t use bullets, numbers, or inline links in the overview.

#### **Links**

* “What would you like to do” section should only link to how-to pages and “What you need to know” section should only link to service detail pages
* Don’t link to contact info from these 2 sections
* Don’t link to other service pages from these 2 sections
* Don’t use URLs to link to how-to pages and service detail pages already created in the CMS. To link to how-to pages and service detail pages, start typing the name of the page you want to link to and use the autocomplete function.
* Don’t fill out the link text for pages already in the CMS unless you want to shorten it. The CMS will automatically fill this field with the name of the page you are linking to.

### How-to and Service Detail Pages

#### **Titles**

* Title is sentence case, meaning the first letter of each word is capitalized. Don’t capitalize words like and, or, by, of. Ex.: “File for unemployment benefits”
* Don’t put a period at the end of a page title
* Title should clearly describe the subject matter in constituent-friendly language
* Title should stand alone. Remember, a user may come to this page through a Google search. Ex.: “Info for families of inmates,” not “Info for families”

#### **Content**

* Use the bullet tool in the CMS. Don’t copy and paste bullets from legacy pages or Word documents.
* Use the table tool in the CMS. Don’t copy and paste tables from legacy pages.
* Use the “Downloads” section to upload documents. Don’t copy and paste document links from the legacy site.
* Use numbered steps sparingly. Use them only in the “How to” section, and only when there is a clear order to the steps a person must take to complete an action.
* On a how-to page, all steps and directions to complete the action belong in the “how-to” section
* “What you need” is for items you need to gather before you apply
* “Next steps” use sparingly, only for actions or information you need immediately after the main action on the page
* The last step of the how-to page should complete the action suggested in the title

####  **Links**

* Don’t use URLs to link to pages already created in the CMS. Start typing the name of the page you want to link to and use the autocomplete function.
* Don’t fill out the link text for pages already in the CMS unless you want to shorten it. The CMS will automatically fill this field with the name of the page you are linking to.
* Contact info should only be linked to within contact info field. Don’t link to contact info in the “Related” section or the “Additional resources” section.

### **Branding and Style**

#### **Use language and tone that’s befitting a state government website**

* Ex.: What’s appropriate in an internal newsletter or on social media may not be appropriate for Mass.gov. When in doubt, please contact your Communications Director or the Mass.gov team at MassITDigitalServices@mass.gov.

#### **Avoid the perception of endorsements, including opinions on health fads, private companies, for-profit orgs**

### **Editorial**

* No spelling errors.
* No grammar errors

#### **Constituent-centric language:**

* Use “our” to refer to your organization Ex.: “Welcome to the Office of the Comptroller of the Commonwealth. Our mission is to promote accountability, integrity, and clarity in Commonwealth business, fiscal, and administrative enterprises.”
* Use “you” to refer to the reader or constituent

#### **Follow Associated Press \(AP\) style for capitalization, spelling, hyphenation rules**

* Phone numbers: Use parentheses around the area code. Ex.: \(800\) 111-2345
* Do not use letters for phone numbers. Ex.: Instead of \(800\) STEEMER, use \(800\) 783-3637. Phone numbers with letters prevent people from using “click-and-call” on their mobile devices, and they are not accessible.

####  **Times**

* Omit “:00”
* Use “a.m.” or “p.m.” \(lowercase, with periods\)
* Use an en-dash without spaces on either side for time ranges. An en-dash \(–\) is slightly wider than a hyphen \(-\) but narrower than an em-dash \( — \)
* Ex.: “9 a.m.–5:30 p.m.”

#### **Correct names of places, organizations, agencies \(e.g. not “National Fish and Wildlife,” but “U.S. Fish and Wildlife”\)**

#### **Bulleted lists:**

* Capitalize first item
* Don’t use periods in bulleted lists, unless bulleted item contains more than 1 sentence
* Don’t repeat introductory sentence material within bullets
* Items should be 2 sentences maximum, preferably 1

####  **Acronyms:** 

AVOID. If really necessary, spell out on first use and follow in parentheses. Ex.: Organization names such as the Department of Revenue \(DOR\).

#### **Circular or confusing language, e.g.**

* “Then, get familiar with town bylaws that pertain to hunting in the towns you want to hunt.”

**No sentence fragments \(outside list items\)**

**Include all relevant info:**

* Links to pages, docs need to be included
* Links to laws or regs should be included if being referenced
* Include phone numbers when they’re mentioned

**No all caps in middle of sentence \(must do x AND y…\)**

**Avoid slashes \(and/or, credit/debit cards, etc\)**
