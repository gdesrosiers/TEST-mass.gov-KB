# Categorize your content

### Summary

### Make sure it's the right content type

The most basic thing you can do is make sure that you're using the right content type. For example, if you're using a Service Detail to publish news instead of a News item, your news won't appear when constituents choose the "News" filter. We've [listed what content types appear under each filtered search in   How search works](mass.gov-search.md#how-does-mass-gov-search-work).

### The organizations\(s\) field

Some constituents might narrow their search by organization. If your organization serves a lot of returning users who know that you publish the information they need, they might use the organization filter \(at the left of the search bar\):

Mass.gov's search knows which pages belong to which organization according to **organization\(s\)** field. You can find the **organization\(s\)** field when you edit any Mass.gov page or document. For HTML pages, the field is always at the bottom of the first tab. For documents, it's a couple fields beneath the **file** field. 

We've already populated the vast majority of **organization\(s\)** across Mass.gov content. ****However, you might find that your organization is missing from 1 or more of your pages — maybe because an author at your parent organization created it, or because an intern affiliated with EOTSS did. Whatever the case, fixing the information in **organization\(s\)** will ensure your content is correctly categorized in Mass.gov's search. \(You might have to wait a few days for Google to re-index your content.\)

### Group your with your parent organization's content in search

Who owns what content can be tricky to determine — especially for someone who doesn’t have an intricate knowledge of the Commonwealth’s government. You might want your content to appear when users search for within your parent organization's content. To do this:

1. Open your Organization Page in "edit." 
2. Under the "More" tab, find the **Organization Parent** field.
3. Add your parent organization.

**Important:** You should only enter your direct parent org into this field. 

Examples:

* The Department of Early Education and Care wants their content to appear when users search for the Executive Office of Education \(EOE\). They would add the EOE Organization Page to their organization parent field. 
* The Bureau of Health Professions Licensure wants their content to appear when users search within the Department of Public Health \(DPH\). They would add the DPH Organization Page to their organization parent field. 
* Grandparent organization example: The Division of Marine Fisheries wants their content to appear when users search for the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs \(EEA\). They would add their parent organization, the Department of Fish and Game \(DFG\) to their Org Page’s organization parent field. Then, the Department of Fish and Game would add the EEA Organization Page to their organization parent field.

How quickly your content begins to appear in searches for your parent organization's content depends on how quickly Google re-crawls the site.

### Add your documents to a filtered search

You can make sure that documents appear in one of Mass.gov's other filtered searches, too. To do this:

1. Find a document in the "All documents" menu.
2. Edit it by clicking the "edit" button on the right
3. Scroll down to the **category** field.
4. Choose the category you want the document to appear under: News, Laws & Regs, or Services

**Note:** Some documents won’t fall into any of these categories. To make sure that our filters are as useful as possible for constituents, please choose mindfully.
