# Content previews

### Content previews: How your content looks when users find it in search

One of our newest enhancements to Mass.gov search are content previews that show up in search results. Getting the most out of these previews depends on how you set up your content.

Service Page previews include links to your **Featured tasks.** If you don’t use the **Featured tasks** field, these won’t appear.

The same is true for How-to pages and the **Quick actions** field:

Search results for Organization Pages will include contact information and, if you’ve included Locations, a link to a Location Listings page.

News includes a posted date, an “eyebrow” or label identifying it as news, and whatever you’ve entered in the **listing description** field.

Law library content \(Regulations and Decisions, for example\), include date posted and an “eyebrow” or label.
