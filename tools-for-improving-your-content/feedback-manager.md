# Feedback Manager

### Overview

The Feedback Manager is a Mass.gov authoring tool that helps you track and analyze user feedback on your content. This feedback comes from the survey at the bottom of every Mass.gov page:

You’ll also be able to tag your content’s user feedback. Tagging feedback helps train our machine learning program on how your feedback should be organized and labeled. In the future, we’ll be able to use machine learning to automatically tag user feedback for you.

### **How it works**

The Feedback Manager is embedded in the CMS. It includes user feedback from any page you are “watching.”

You are automatically assigned as a watcher for any page you’ve created or edited. If you want to watch a page you’ve never worked on, find it on edit.mass.gov and click “watch” in the upper right:

Please note that this is only the first iteration of the Feedback Manager. We’re excited to hear what features you’d like us to add to it and how you will use it so that we can improve it. You can [submit your comments to us via ServiceNow](https://medium.com/massdigital/using-servicenow-to-request-mass-gov-support-5611afb28252).

### How to use

#### **Step \#1: Find the Feedback Manager in the CMS**

Reminder: Only content you are watching will show up in the ‘Filter by Page.’

#### **Step \#2: Select a page to see the feedback it has received**

You can also:

* Choose a category of feedback in the **Filter by tag** dropdown. \(If you haven’t yet tagged any of a page’s feedback, this filter will, tragically, return no results. See Step \#4 for how to add or remove tags.\)
* Sort the data by newest or oldest at the top
* Choose to view only “Yes” or only “No” responses, or view both at once

It is also possible to filter _only_ by feedback tag or “Did you find” status. To do this, leave the **Filter by page** filter blank, and pick at least one option from **Filter by tag** or **Filter by “Did you find?” status.**

#### **Step \#3 View feedback**

Once you’ve finishing picking your filters, you can begin reading your content’s feedback. From left to right, each row contains:

* Date: The date feedback was received
* Did You Find: Whether the user responded “yes” or “no” to the “Did you find what you were looking for” survey
* Source Page: The page the feedback is from
* Feedback Text: The user’s verbatim feedback
* Tags: Any tag that’s been applied to the feedback so far

#### **Step \#4 Add or remove tags**

To add a tag, click the “Add tag” button:

A tag dropdown will appear. Select the tag you think best fits from this menu. For example, you might tag “senior lifetime pass” with “Adult and Senior Care,” and “how much is parking” could be tagged “Location Information.”

After you’ve added a tag, it will appear in the Feedback Manager next to the response:

Items can have up to 3 tags:

To remove a tag, click the “Remove tag” link next to each:

If you want to request a new tag, request it through ServiceNow.

### How does tagging feedback benefit you?

There are 2 reasons to tag your feedback. First, it is practical: On heavily-trafficked pages with a lot of feedback, tagging helps you organize that feedback, and to identify patterns in what users say. Then, you can make informed decisions about how to improve your content based on your user data.

Second, in the future, we plan to take advantage of _machine learning_ to automatically tag feedback. This means that we can teach a machine learning program to identify patterns, and to associate labels with those patterns. Our machine learning program will eventually be able to identify what kind of feedback should be tagged with “Contact information,” “Document Upload and Management,” “Compliment,” and so on.

The more data we give our machine learning program, the better it will be at recognizing which tags are appropriate for which types of feedback. Similarly, the more feedback you tag, the better it will be at learning how your feedback should be categorized.

#### **What if the tag you need isn’t there?**

Request a new one through ServiceNow.
