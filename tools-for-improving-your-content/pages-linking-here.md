# Pages Linking Here

### Summary

“Pages Linking Here” is a content management system \(CMS\) tool that shows which pages link to a specific page or document.

You can use it to check if your content is well-connected across Mass.gov, and to make sure you don’t break links if you plan to remove pages or documents.

Note that the tool does not identify pages that connect to your content through inline links in a rich text editor field. It only shows pages in which an author added links through structured fields.

This tool might feel familiar if you worked in the old Percussion CMS. Percussion featured a tool called “Impact Analysis,” and we’ve had many requests to add something like it to the current CMS.

“Pages Linking Here” is not an “Impact Analysis” clone. But you can use it to see which pages link to each piece of content. So, if you plan to send a Service Detail to the trash or unpublish a document, for example, you can find out ahead of time which pages you’ll affect and avoid breaking links.

Using “Pages Linking Here” differs slightly depending on whether you’re reviewing documents or non-document content.

#### Step 6:

If you click on the page title, you’ll go directly to that page, where you’ll be able to see the link to the piece of content that you’re using “Pages Linking Here” to examine.

### **Content strategy tips**

You can use “Pages Linking Here” to gain insights into whether your content connects optimally across Mass.gov. For instance, if “Pages Linking Here” shows that one of your Service Detail or How-To pages is not linked from at least one Service page, as they should be, you can then address the situation.

If you’re reviewing a piece of content with “Pages Linking Here” and find that links to the content don’t appear on any pages, then you’ll see the following:
