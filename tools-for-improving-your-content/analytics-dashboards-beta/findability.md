# Findability

{% hint style="warning" %}
⛔ **Dec. 3, 4:58 p.m.** — This morning we discovered a technical issue causing errors in the scores you see in the [Analytics Dashboards \(Beta\)](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/tools-for-improving-your-content/analytics-dashboards-beta/introduction-to-dashboards) and the [“All Content” view](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/tools-for-improving-your-content/get-a-snapshot-of-your-contents-performance) in the CMS. We are currently working to investigate and resolve this issue.

In the meanwhile, to ensure the dashboards and CMS show accurate data, the dashboards will only display data prior to Nov. 1. This means **all of the scores you’ll see are based on data from Oct. 1-31 or May-October**.

## Summary

Findability measures how easy it is for users to find your content. The score is based on what percentage of your traffic comes from important sources. Usually, this means from search engines \(organic\) and from parent pages.

On this tab, you’ll see:

* Traffic
* Important sources
* Entrance and exit URLs

## **Traffic**

Here we give you 2 charts that show you the total unique pageviews for this page. The number on the left represents the last full calendar month and the chart on the right shows traffic over time. Traffic is not included as a scoring indicator. It’s just great information for you to see.

## **Important sources**

The second set of charts will show you your percentage of traffic from important sources:

* A parent page \(typically a Topic, Org, or Service Page\)
* Organic, or a search engine \(Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.\)
* Social \(Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pintrest, Tumblr, Hootsuite, Buffer, Netvibes\)
* Mass.gov homepage

A parent page is a page that links to other pages in a way that creates a relationship. For example, a Service page is a parent page to pages that are linked in the **Top Tasks**, **All other Tasks**, or **What would you need to know** sections. These pages are also called child or children pages. When you’re on the child page, you’ll see a button that shows how this page is related to other pages.

Your organic traffic will benefit from using terms common to your audience. The better your keywords are, the better your search engine traffic will be. Sometimes the more technical names for things aren’t the words visitors use when searching.

These 4 categories of important sources make up your findability score because these are the ways visitors should be finding your content. Visitors are either clicking on links and page titles that line up with what they are looking for or searching for this specific subject matter.

## **Entrance and exit URLs**

Like User Satisfaction, we have provided some additional information here to help you figure out whether your page is findable. There are 2 tables here:

* Entrance URLs — links that your users were visiting immediately before coming to your page
* Exit URLs — links they went to upon leaving your page

Other Mass.gov pages might show up here because they are related links. Direct traffic will show as "direct." This means someone started on this page in their web browser. They probably clicked on a link in an email or used a bookmark in their browser.
