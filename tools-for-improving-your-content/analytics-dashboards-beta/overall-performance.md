# Overall performance

### Summary

Think of this tab as your homepage. It offers a high-level snapshot of your content’s overall performance score and the scores of all the categories that make up the overall score.

On this tab you’ll see your content’s:

* Overall performance score
* The score for each individual category \(**Note**: the number of categories displayed depends on the content type you’re viewing\)
* Unique pageviews by device \(last 30 days\)
* Unique pageviews \(last 90 days\)

### **Overall performance score**

You’ll see the overall score for this content in the top left of this tab along with a chart that shows the score over time to the right. This overall score is an average of all the other categories.

Right below it, you’ll see the scores from the other 3–4 categories so you can see which scores drive the average up or down.

This is a great place to track how your edits have affected your scores. Keep track of when you made edits and line that up with these scores to show how the scores change over time. If you click on each of the titles on the over time chart, you can see them individually or as a group.

We have also included unique pageviews by device type over the last 30 days. This gives you information on what type of device visitors are using to see your page, whether it’s a computer, mobile phone, or tablet. This is not used toward your overall score.

You will also find a graph that shows unique pageviews \(or traffic\) over time. Traffic by itself doesn’t say much about your content, but it is very useful for giving context to other data and is not counted in your overall score.

You can see how edits have affected your traffic and if your page naturally performs better at different times. We call this seasonality. For example, tax pages will have higher traffic leading up to Tax Day, and parks pages have higher traffic in the summer.
