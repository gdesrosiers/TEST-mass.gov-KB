### Summary

Like the content quality tab, this tab will also look the same no matter what content type you’re viewing. Here you’ll see:

* “No” rate
* “No” responses per 1,000 visitors
* “Yes” & “No” count

### **“No” rate**

This is the percentage of visitors who answered “No” to the question “Did you find what you’re looking for on this webpage?” For example, if 10 visitors answered, and 5 of them said no, your No rate is 50%.

You’ll see there are two charts here representing this number. The current percentage along with the percentage over time.

### **“No” responses per 1,000 visitors**

While 50% of the responders may have said no, it’s important to know what portion of your audience that represents. If your audience is 10,000 visitors a month, that’s not that bad. If it’s 100 visitors a month, that’s a bigger concern. Here we also show you the No’s/1,000 over time.

### **“Yes” & “No” count**

We have also included a few additional metrics here:

* Yes and No Counts
* Full number of responses
* Word cloud featuring the most popular words left in feedback
