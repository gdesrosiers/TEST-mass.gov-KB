⛔ **Dec. 3, 4:58 p.m.** — This morning we discovered a technical issue causing errors in the scores you see in the [Analytics Dashboards \(Beta\)](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/tools-for-improving-your-content/analytics-dashboards-beta/introduction-to-dashboards) and the [“All Content” view](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/tools-for-improving-your-content/get-a-snapshot-of-your-contents-performance) in the CMS. We are currently working to investigate and resolve this issue.

In the meanwhile, to ensure the dashboards and CMS show accurate data, the dashboards will only display data prior to Nov. 1. This means **all of the scores you’ll see are based on data from Oct. 1-31 or May-October**.

## Summary

Like the content quality tab, this tab will also look the same no matter what content type you’re viewing. Here you’ll see:

* “No” rate
* “No” responses per 1,000 visitors
* “Yes” & “No” count

## **“No” rate**

This is the percentage of visitors who answered “No” to the question “Did you find what you’re looking for on this webpage?” For example, if 10 visitors answered, and 5 of them said no, your No rate is 50%.

You’ll see there are 2 charts here representing this number. Last month's percentage along with the percentage over the last 6 months.

## **“No” responses per 1,000 visitors**

While 50% of respondents may have said no, it’s important to know what portion of your audience that represents. If your audience is 10,000 visitors a month, that’s not too bad. If it’s 100 visitors a month, that’s a bigger concern. To the right of this percentage we show you the No’s/1,000 over the last 6 months.

## **“Yes” & “No” count**

We have also included a few additional metrics here:

* Yes and No Counts
* Full number of responses
