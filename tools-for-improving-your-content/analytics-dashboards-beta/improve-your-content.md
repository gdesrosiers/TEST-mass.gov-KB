Each Improve Your Content tab is specific to a content type, and covers the advice we would give in each of the 4 categories. If you click on the bar, a list of suggestions shows up that you can use to make improvements to your pages.

In the description for this tab, you will see a live link that takes you to a form where you can [sign-up for a strategy session with the content team](../../get-help-from-the-mass.gov-team/content-strategy-session.md).

If you’re unsure about which next steps to take to improve your content, or you’ve worked through the checklist suggestions but still don’t see the improvements you expected, consider signing up for a session.
