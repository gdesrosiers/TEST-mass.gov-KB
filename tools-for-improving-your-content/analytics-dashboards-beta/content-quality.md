# Content quality

### Summary

Content Quality is scored in 2 areas: broken links and readability. This is the category that will tell you if you are providing content that is easy for visitors to read and understand.

These indicators are populated every 5 days by Siteimprove. This tool can highlight difficult words, misspellings, and broken links for you, making them all easy to fix. If you would like to create a Siteimprove account, please let us know through [ServiceNow](https://massgov.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0bb8e784dbec0700f132fb37bf9619fe).

### **Broken links**

This indicator tells you the number of broken links that are on your page. If you do not have any broken links, you will see a 0. If you have 10 broken links, you will see a 10. You should have zero broken links on your page.

### **Readability**

Readability is how difficult it is to read your content. It is measured by a test that tells you what grade level your content is written for.

The targeted readability for Mass.gov content is Grade 6, but we know this is more difficult for some content than others. If your content has a reading level between 6th and 8th grade, you will score well in this area.
