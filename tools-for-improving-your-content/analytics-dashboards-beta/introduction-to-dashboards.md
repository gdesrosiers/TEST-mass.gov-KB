# Introduction

All content has a purpose. The Mass.gov Analytics Dashboards \(Beta\) are tools to help you determine if your content is fulfilling its purpose. These dashboards deliver simplified, actionable data from within the CMS. Like everything on Mass.gov, these dashboards are a continual work-in-progress. These are not be-all end-all scores. They’re a starting point. They’re going to evolve as we learn more together and refine how we determine each score.

We’re beginning with dashboards for these content types: Service, Service Details, and How-to pages. We’ll add more over time.

When you visit the dashboards, you’ll see the following tabs:

* [Overall performance](overall-performance.md)
* [Findability](findability.md)
* [Outcomes](outcomes.md) \(except on Service Detail pages\)
* [Content quality](content-quality.md)
* [User satisfaction](user-satisfaction.md)
* [Improve your content](improve-your-content.md)

There’s a ton of data displayed in these dashboards, and with that comes a lot of explanations about what it means and what to do with it. We’ve created separate resources, listed above, for each of these tabs, featuring explanations and actionable suggestions.

### How it works

Each page receives an overall score from 0–4. A score of 3 or 4 means your content is currently one of the top pages of that content type on Mass.gov. A score under 3 means there are definitely still ways to improve your page. Many of these improvements are easy fixes to make.

This overall score is made up of 4 categories:

* Findability — Is it easy for users to find your page?
* Outcomes — If your page is transactional, are they taking the intended action? If the page is focused on directing the user to other pages, are they following your links?
* Content quality — Do you have any broken links? Is your content written at an appropriate grade level?
* User satisfaction — How many people didn’t find what they were looking for?

Beyond our 3 content type-specific dashboards, general dashboards can be found on 18 other content types that offer a higher-level view of:

* Traffic
* Content quality
* User satisfaction
* Improve Your Content

### Getting to your dashboards

The Analytics Dashboards \(Beta\) deliver clear, actionable information about how users interact with your content. These dashboards can be found across a total of 21 content types in the CMS.

No matter which content type you’re on, you’ll see the same Analytics tab in the top right corner of the page next to the Revisions tab:

Each tab will feature unique data and indicators that are used to produce your content’s overall score.

### Export your data from the dashboards

All data displayed on tables or charts can be exported as a comma-separated values \(CSV\) file. To begin an export, hover your mouse over the top-right corner of a chart or table. You will see a little green table appear and the words “Export CSV” above it:

You can use this feature to dig deeper into your content’s performance. For example, identifying where most of your traffic is coming from and determining if there are pathways you didn’t expect to see, or ones that are missing.
