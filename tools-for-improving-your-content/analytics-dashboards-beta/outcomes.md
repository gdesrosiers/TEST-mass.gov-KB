# Outcomes

### Summary

Outcomes look at whether pages help visitors complete their intended tasks on Mass.gov. The outcomes tab currently only appears on How-to and Service pages and can vary depending on which content type you’re viewing.

On a How-to page, you’ll see:

* How-to action rate
* Action rate over time
* Top actions taken

On a Service page, you’ll see:

* % traffic to children pages, such as How-to and Service Details
* Action rate of children

### **How-to Page actions**

Since How-tos are built to promote transactions, we score Outcomes using the Action Rate.

The Action Rate is the percentage of visitors to your page who perform an action. For example, if 100 people visit your page and 10 of them click on something, your Action rate is 10%. This includes downloading a file, clicking to an external application or a Form page, or clicking on location or contact information.

We have also included a chart that tells you the top actions taken with the exact number of clicks for that action. The number of clicks is on the right side of the chart. You might have to scroll to see them.

### **Service Page actions**

Service pages are slightly different.

The purpose of a Service Page is to drive traffic to pages linked to it like How-tos, Service Details, Info Details, Guides, Lists, etc.

The score for Service pages is based on the percent of traffic going to the linked pages and also the Action Rate of those pages.

This is another reason why it’s important to link your pages correctly on the site. Make sure you’re using the autocomplete fields to link to How-to Pages in the “What would you like to do?” section and informational content \(Service Details, Info Details, Curated Lists, etc.\) in the “What you should know” section. Doing so will improve your scores and your page’s performance.
