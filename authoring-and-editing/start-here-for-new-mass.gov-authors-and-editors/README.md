# Start here: For new Mass.gov authors & editors

## The guiding vision of Mass.gov

The new Mass.gov is _constituent-centered._ Constituents come to Mass.gov to do something specific — renew a license, file an application, or get specific information. We want them to do what they need to do or find what they need to find quickly and easily. This is why Mass.gov is organized around the various services that state organizations offer their constituents.

As you make your way through this training kit, keep these goals in mind:

* What are the main programs, transactions, and services that your organization offers constituents \(i.e. Mass.gov website users\)?
* Who are your users \(i.e. students, nurses, small businesses\)? Depending on your organization’s goals, “constituent-centered” might mean businesses or other government organizations.
* How can you plan and author content to make it easy for your users to find what they need?

## The Content Management System \(CMS\)

You write and publish content to Mass.gov using the Content Management System, or CMS. In this section, you’ll learn the basics of navigating the CMS. Later, you’ll learn about a few of the most important content types.

A _content type_ is a template for displaying content. \(Content is everything users interact with and experience: Text, image, sound, downloads, etc.\) We use content types to make sure that information appears in similar patterns across Mass.gov, even if different authors from different organizations create it. While this sometimes limits what you can do, it’s very helpful for users. To understand why, think about the U.S. road system: If you learn to drive in one state, you’ve pretty much learned to drive in all of them, since the rules are very similar. Things would be a lot worse if every state had totally different road rules.

### **Getting started**

You’ll need to log in to the CMS. You should have received a separate set of instructions about logging in. [Submit a ServiceNow support request to the Mass.gov team if you need help](../../get-help-from-the-mass.gov-team/servicenow-request-support-from-the-mass.gov-team.md).

### **You’re in. Now what?**

Let’s learn about where a few important things are. At the top of the screen, you’ll see a dark green bar with 2 menu options: “Content” and your account name.

![Content menu &amp; submenus](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*JBSZbygt-vayqlUtBlBI3g.jpeg)

For now, the only tab you need to worry about is “Content.” **Note:** You might see slightly different options depending on what your _permissions_ status is. For example, if you are an “editor,” you’ll see a “Needs Review” option under “Content.”

Here’s what’s important under the “Content” tab:

* The “Needs Review” \(editors only\) menu lists all content that’s been marked as “needs review.” You can filter by title, content type, or the reviser’s user name.
* The “All Content” menu shows all the content in the CMS. You can filter by title, content type, last user to revise, and whether or not the content is published.
* The “All Documents” tab takes you to an index of all the documents on Mass.gov. You’ll most often search for documents while you are authoring a page. If your organization uses a lot of documents, [you might want to read about how documents work in the CMS.](../documents/)
* “My Content” lists all the content you’ve authored, revised, or are “watching.” Watching is like being a subscriber to that content: You’ll be notified anybody saves a change to it. By default, you “watch” any piece of content you edit or make. You can search for content here just like you can on “All Content.”
* “Feedback” opens the [Feedback Manager](../../tools-for-improving-your-content/feedback-manager.md), where you can see what comments constituents have left on your content.
* “Trash” \(editors only\) lets you find and recover content that’s been moved to the trash.

### **Creating Content**

To create content, click the green “Add content” button at the top of the CMS.

### Content Types

Each Mass.gov content type has a specific purpose. \(A content type is like a template for laying out your text, images, and downloads.\) Content types are grouped into 5 categories:

* _Services & Info:_ Content types for transactions, services, and information that your organization offers its users
* _Org & Contact Info:_ Content types for info about your organization, including locations
* _News & Events:_ News, events, and alerts
* _Laws & Regs:_ Law library content types
* _Other:_ For now, all that’s here is the Legacy Redirect, which you can use to direct traffic from your legacy content to your newer Mass.gov content. [Learn about Legacy Redirects](../../content-types/legacy-redirects.md).

If you need to learn the content types, we recommend starting with the service suite, or the 4 page types at the heart of Mass.gov. 

#### **The Service Page**

Service Pages are the faces for your organization’s services. Each includes all the important transactions and information that make up a service or program your organization oversees.

Service Page resources:

* [Learn about authoring Service Pages](../../content-types/service-page.md)
* [Get help identifying your services](../../mass.gov-style/tips-for-identifying-services.md)

The Service Page usually includes several types of subpages — or pages that go into depth on some aspect of your service. Here they are:

#### **How-to Pages**

How-to Pages help users do something. It’s an essential part of the service suite, since needing to accomplish something is a main reason constituents visit Mass.gov.

How-to Pages might include a description of how to accomplish something, fee information, key downloads, and links to other applications.

* [Learn about authoring How-to Pages](../../content-types/how-to-pages.md)

#### **Information Details and Service Details**

Constituents might also need information — more information than you can include in the Service Page’s overview. The 2 main content types for informational pages are the _Information Detail_ and _Service Detail._ In addition to text and images, you can also add videos and iFrames.

The main difference between them is that Information Details are designed for long-form content. However, if you have brief, simple content, a Service Detail works fine.

* [Learn about authoring Information Details](../../content-types/information-details.md)
* [Learn about authoring Service Details](../../content-types/service-detail.md)

#### **Other page types**

There are lots of other content types to help you communicate with your users. Some you might want to know about are:

* [Contact Information](../../content-types/contact-information-items.md)
* [Curated Lists](../../content-types/curated-lists/)
* [Guides](../../content-types/guides.md)
* [Organization Pages](../../content-types/organization-pages/)

### Draft, Publish, Unpublish, and Trash

At the bottom of every content creation screen, you’ll see a blue dropdown menu. Here’s what the options you’ll see mean:

* Save and Create New Draft: Your work will be saved, but it will not be live on the internet. You’ll also see this called a “prepublished draft.” Only CMS users who are logged in will be able to view it.
* Save and Request Review: Saves a draft of your content and marks it as needing review. Other CMS users \(like anyone who has to approve your work\) will be able to search for and find it in the “Needs Review” menu.
* Save and Publish \(editors only\): Publishes your work. Anybody who has the URL will be able get to your content. It will also be searchable on Mass.gov and search engines.
* Save and Move to Trash \(editors only\): This is like moving a file to the recycle bin on your computer. An editor will be able recover the content if you need it, but it will be moved out of the “All Content” and “My Content” views in the CMS.

These options change the “moderation state” of your content — that is, if it’s available to the public. Here are the most important “moderation states” and what they mean:

**Unpublished:** A saved copy of your content exists, but is not available to anybody outside of the Mass.gov CMS \([except through a temporary access link](../temporary-unpublished-access.md)\).

**Published:** Your content is live on the internet. Even if you don’t link it anywhere, users will be able to find it on Google. \(Exception: [Some content types](../../content-types/contact-information-items.md) are only used as data for other content types. These will never be available to the public.\)

**Published with a newer, unpublished draft:** You can also save a new draft of already published content. When you do this, users who come to your content will see the most recently published version. As an author or editor, you’ll also see a “Latest version” option at in your tool bar:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OBLU7B8CoeutY9qo6JAoqg.jpeg)

**Trash:** Your content has been moved to the trash. To remove it from the trash, [an editor will have to find it and restore it from the “Trash” submenu](../trash.md) \(“Content” -&gt; “Trash”\).
