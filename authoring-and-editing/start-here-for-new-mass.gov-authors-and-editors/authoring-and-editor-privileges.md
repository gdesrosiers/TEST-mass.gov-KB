# Authoring and Editor Privileges

## Author and Editor Roles

There are 2 user roles in the Mass.gov Content Management System \(CMS\): Author and Editor. The Author role is ideal for users who should have their work reviewed before it is published. 

**Authors can:** 

* Draft content
* Watch content
* Edit content
* Upload documents and other media files
* Replace documents and other medial files with new versions

**Authors cannot:**

* Publish, unpublish or move content to the Trash.

**Editors can:**

* Use all author privileges
* Publish content
* Unpublish content
* Move content to the Trash

Beyond these 2 user roles, permissions can be added to work with specific content types. For example, an author or an editor can be given permissions to create Legacy Redirects.
