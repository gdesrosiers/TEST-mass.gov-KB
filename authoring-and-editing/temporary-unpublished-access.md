# Temporary unpublished access

### Summary

Sometimes you need to show your unpublished content to somebody who does not have a Drupal login. Maybe you need a subject matter expert’s approval, or a supervisor’s. You can do this by giving your reviewer temporary acces_s_ to your unpublished page. This resource will show you how to do this.

### Step 1

Find the Temporary Unpublished Access menu on the right side of your draft, and click the arrow to open the menu.

### Step 2

The **Lifetime** dropdown allows you to choose how long you want the temporary link to work. The link will be always be to the latest draft of the page. This means that a link with an “unlimited” lifetime will continue to provide access to the latest version of that page.

When you’ve made your choice, click “Get link.” You can take away access by deleting an existing link. Open the Temporary Unpublished Access menu to see the links you’ve created and to access the Delete button for each of them.

### Step 3

This link is temporary. \(Sometimes it’s called a “token.”\) It works a little bit like coin-operated binoculars at the top of a mountain: once activated, it allows users to see something they otherwise couldn’t for a period of time.

Next, click “Copy to clipboard.” Don’t send it yet, though — there’s one more important step.

### Step 4

Paste your link into an email \(or whatever medium you’re using to send it to your reviewer\). Before you send it, make sure you change the “edit” to “www":
