# Images

You can use the [editing toolbar \(rich text editor\)](editing-toolbar.md) to add images to your pages. Many content types have fields with rich text editors — the authoring interface with formatting buttons at the top. For example, the **Overview** on a service details page is a rich text editor field.

You can either upload a new image or add an image you've used before. 

### Important things to know about embedding an image

* Your image will display at either half or the full width of the editor area \(Note: This doesn't apply to an Information Details **header media** field\)
* The full width of this area is 800 x 470 pixels on a full-size screen
* Make sure you use an image with a resolution close to these dimensions. An image that is smaller than the size you’ve chosen will be resized to fill the space, and will usually look blurry.

### How to add a new image

#### Step 1

Click on the "Insert Image" button in any rich text field.

**Step 4**

Click the **Use selected** button. If you're using a smaller screen, you might have to scroll a little to see it.

**Step 5**

A menu will appear with display options. 

First, choose whether you want your image to display at full or half width.

Next, add your alternative text. Alternative text isn’t a caption. It replaces the image for users who don’t see it. Users with screen readers will hear this text instead of seeing the image, and if the image doesn’t load for any reason, the alternative text will appear instead. Alternative text should provide the same information as the image, so be sure it clearly substitute for whatever the image conveys.

**Step 6**

Your image should now be visible in your rich text field and will appear on the page when you save.
