# Trash

## Summary

The trash function works a lot like the recycle bin on your computer: You can place items that you don’t need there to get them out of the way, and you can get them back if it turns out that you shouldn’t have thrown them out.

## Moving items to trash

There are 2 ways to trash items. You can do it in “edit” mode, and you can do it from one of the content management screens.

### **From “edit” mode**

After you’ve opened your content by clicking “new draft” or “edit,” find the blue dropdown menu in the bottom left. Open it and select “Save and move to trash.” This will save any changes and move your content to the trash.

You can do this for both unpublished drafts and published content. If you move published content to the trash, it will no longer be available on the web.

### **From “My content” and “All content”**

On the right side of the page, under “Actions,” open the “edit” dropdown. Select “Set to trash.” You can do this for both unpublished drafts and published content.

## Recovering trashed items

Find the “Trash” menu under “Content.”

Then, select the content you want to restore and click the “Restore” button:

**Important:** When you restore an item from the trash, it becomes unpublished content — even if when you trashed it, it was published. If you need it published, you’ll need to edit it and republish it.
