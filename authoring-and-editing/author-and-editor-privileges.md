# Author and Editor Privileges

### **Author and Editor Roles**

There are 2 basic user roles in the Mass.gov Content Management System \(CMS\): Author and Editor. The Author role is ideal for users who should have their work reviewed before it is published.

**Authors can:**

* Create content
* Watch content
* Edit ANY content
* Upload documents and other media files
* Replace documents and other media files with new files

**Authors cannot:**

* Publish, unpublish, or delete content

**Editors can:**

* Use all author privileges
* Publish ANY content, including files attached to documents
* Unpublish ANY content by moving it into the Trash

Beyond these 2 base levels of user roles, certain permissions can be added in order to work with specific content types. For example, an author or an editor can have the additional role of Redirect Creator to create Legacy Redirects in the CMS.

### **Request a new user author or editor role**

To create a new user role, we ask that a communications director submit a[ ServiceNow support request](https://massgov.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0bb8e784dbec0700f132fb37bf9619fe). When submitting a request for user accounts, please include:

* The name of each user
* Their state email address
* Which role you would like them to have \(i.e. author or editor\)
