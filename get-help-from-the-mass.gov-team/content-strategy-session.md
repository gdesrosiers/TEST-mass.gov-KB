# Content strategy session

### Summary

  
Want to improve your Mass.gov content? Need help with the CMS? Make an appointment for a content strategy session, and the Digital Services content team will help you to structure your content and present it clearly and efficiently.

The Digital Services team offers in-person content strategy sessions \(formerly called office hours\) to help you envision, develop, and improve your constituent-focused content.

Appointments typically run half an hour, but can be longer if you need to discuss a particularly challenging issue.

### How to make an appointment

To make the best use of your time, come prepared with questions and pages you have written.

Sessions are available by appointment at the Technology and Security Services office:

1 Ashburton Place  
8th Floor  
Boston, MA 02108
