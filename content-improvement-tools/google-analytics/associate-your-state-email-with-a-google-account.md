# Associate your state email with a google account

## Overview

You can learn a lot about how your content is performing through the Mass.gov Google Analytics account.

However, to get access to Google Analytics, you’ll first need to associate your state email with a Google account. This takes about 2 minutes. Find out how below.

After you associate your state email with Google Analytics, you may [submit a ServiceNow support request](https://massgov.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0bb8e784dbec0700f132fb37bf9619fe) asking for access. After MA Digital Service grants you access, you’ll be able to visit [analytics.google.com](analytics.google.com) to see your content’s data.

### What you need:

* A state email address

### Step 1: Go to [accounts.google.com](accounts.google.com) in your browser

**Note:** If you’re already logged in to your personal Google account, you may need to log out. Otherwise, you’ll be taken to your personal accounts landing page, and you won’t be able to move on to step 2.
{% endhint %}

### Step 3: Associate your state email with a Google Account

Google will want your first and last name, your state email, and a password.

In this step, you’re asking Google to let you log in to Google products, such as Google Analytics, using your state email address. This means that you’re basically creating a new account with a password. This password is not associated with your actual email: You’ll still log in to Outlook the same way you do now. Instead, you’ll use it when you log in to Google with your state email address.

When you’re done, click next.

### Step 4: Verify your email

Google will send a code to your state email. Find it and enter it:

## Why can’t I just use my personal Google email?

We ask state employees who want to take advantage of Google Analytics to go through this process to improve security. It also makes it easier for us to collaborate with you: It’s much easier to share reports and dashboards with state email addresses than to track down an unusually formatted Gmail account.
