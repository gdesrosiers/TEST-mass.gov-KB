# Overall performance

{% hint style="warning" %}
⛔ **Dec. 3, 4:58 p.m.** — This morning we discovered a technical issue causing errors in the scores you see in the [Analytics Dashboards \(Beta\)](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/tools-for-improving-your-content/analytics-dashboards-beta/introduction-to-dashboards) and the [“All Content” view](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/tools-for-improving-your-content/get-a-snapshot-of-your-contents-performance) in the CMS. We are currently working to investigate and resolve this issue.

In the meanwhile, to ensure the dashboards and CMS show accurate data, the dashboards will only display data prior to Nov. 1. This means **all of the scores you’ll see are based on data from Oct. 1-31 or May-October**.

## Summary

Think of this tab as your homepage. It offers a high-level snapshot of your content’s overall performance score and the scores of all the categories that make up the overall score.

On this tab you’ll see your content’s:

* Overall performance score \(last full month\)
* Overall performance score \(last 6 months\)
* Score for each individual category \(last full month\)
* Scores for each individual category \(last 6 months\)
* Unique pageviews by device \(last full month\)
* Unique pageviews \(last 6 months\)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: The number of categories displayed depends on the content type you’re viewing.

## **Overall performance score**

You’ll see the overall score for this content in the top left of this tab along with a chart that shows the score over time to the right. This overall score is an average of all the other categories.

Right below it, you’ll see the scores from the other 3–4 categories so you can see which scores drive the average up or down.

This is a great place to track how your edits have affected your scores. Keep track of when you made edits and line that up with these scores to show how the scores change over time. If you click on each of the titles on the over time chart, you can see them individually or as a group.

We have also included unique pageviews by device type over the last full month. This gives you information on what type of device visitors are using to see your page, whether it’s a computer, mobile phone, or tablet. This is not used toward your overall score.

You will also find a graph that shows unique pageviews \(or traffic\) over the last 6 months. Traffic by itself doesn’t say much about your content, but it is very useful for giving context to other data and is not counted in your overall score.

You can see how edits have affected your traffic and if your page naturally performs better at different times. We call this seasonality. For example, tax pages will have higher traffic leading up to Tax Day, and parks pages have higher traffic in the summer.
