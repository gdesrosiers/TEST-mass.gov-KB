# Needs attention dashboard

## **Summary**

In order to consistently deliver constituents the best digital experience possible, it’s important to maintain high performing content. The [Analytics Dashboards \(Beta\)]() help identify the performance of your content, but it can be difficult knowing where to begin.

The Needs Attention Dashboard will help you answer that question. This dashboard displays your organization’s 10 most-trafficked pages with an [Overall score]() of 2.9 or below.

## **How it works**

You’ll find the Needs Attention Dashboard below the “Latest release notes” box on the author landing page.

This dashboard will display up to 10 of your organization's top-trafficked pages with an [Overall score]() below 3, according to the Analytics Dashboards \(Beta\).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The scores on this dashboard will update each calendar month after they've been recalculated. This means that if you make any revisions, they won't be reflected until the next month's calculation.
{% endhint %}

The content displayed on this dashboard isn’t necessarily content you’ve created or edited, it’s any page where the information in the **Organization\(s\)** field matches the organization tied to your user account.

_For example:_ the EOTSS Employee Resources page has Digital Services in its **Organization\(s\)** field. If this page scores a 2.9 or below, it will appear on the Needs Attention Dashboard for all Digital Services users.

If you want to see the full list of your organization’s content, click the “full list of this content” link in the help text.

This link will take you to the “All content” page with pre-filtered results. The filters will already contain your organization and will only show pages with a score of 3 or below.

Here you’ll also be able to find snoozed content and which authors or editors are responsible for the content.

There’s a lot of information packed into this dashboard, so let’s take a look at each column.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Only content types that feature custom Analytics Dashboards \(Beta\) will appear on this dashboard: Service, Service Details, Information Details, and How-to pages.
{% endhint %}

* Page Views \(1 month\) - Total number of pageviews over the last 30 days.
* Title
* Content Type - Only pages with Analytics Dashboards \(Service, Service Details, Information Details, and How-to\) will appear
* Score - The overall score of the page, according to the Analytics Dashboards. Click the number to go directly to the dashboards to get a better sense of what’s going on with this page.
* Last Revised
* Snooze content for 4 weeks

## **Snoozing content**

After you’ve made revisions to the page, you can remove it from the list by clicking the “snooze” button. This will remove the page for the next 4 weeks. If your revisions caused the page’s score to rise above 3, it won’t appear again once the 4 weeks are up.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important:** When you snooze content, it will be snoozed across the CMS. This means it won’t appear in anyone else’s Needs Attention Dashboard. Only snooze content you’ve personally revised.
{% endhint %}

When you snooze a page, you’ll see the following message in a grey box: “_\[Page title\]_ has been snoozed, and will disappear from this table on page refresh. Undo.”

Click “Undo” if you don’t want to snooze the page just yet. If you do want to snooze it, you can close the box by clicking the “x” on the far right side or leave the row alone. Once you return to this page, the item will have been snoozed.

To see more pages that need attention, refresh the table by clicking the “See more content that needs attention” link in the bottom left of the table. This link will only appear if you have more content that didn’t originally fit on the dashboard.

### **See snoozed content**

If you want to check on content you’ve previously snoozed, click the “See snoozed content” link at the bottom of the table to see all your organization's snoozed content.

This link will take you to the All content screen where you can filter between snoozed and un-snoozed content, among other filters.
