# Export All content data

## Summary

You can export lists of filtered results from the ‘All content” page into a comma-separated values \(CSV\) file. This can be helpful if you’re looking for a high-level view of your content based on specific organizations, content types, page titles, or other filters.

### Step 1: Filter

You can filter by 1 or more of the following:

* Title
* Node ID
* Content type
* Publication status
* Last revised by
* Organization
* \(Dashboards\) Score is less than or equal to

The downloadable file will include data from these 7 filters plus a link to the content, the date it was created the date it was last revised, and the number of pageviews from the last 30 days.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** At this time, you can only filter by 1 organization at a time.
{% endhint %}

### Step 2: Export

After you’ve filtered your results, click the orange “CSV” button on the bottom left of the page:
