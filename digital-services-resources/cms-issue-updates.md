# CMS status updates

## Dec. 12, 2018

✔ **Dec. 12, 3:38 p.m.** — We previously reported an issue where users were not able to access the Feedback Manager. We have fixed this issue.

⛔ **Dec. 12, 9:42 a.m.** — There is an issue with accessing the Feedback Manager in the CMS. Users have reported a 404 error when trying to open the tool. We’re currently investigating the issue. We’ll let you know as soon as we release the fix.

In the meantime, if you need to review page-specific feedback, the [in-page feedback tool](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/tools-for-improving-your-content/feedback-manager#in-page-feedback) is still working as expected.

## Dec. 3, 2018

⛔ **Dec. 3, 4:58 p.m.** — This morning we discovered a technical issue causing errors in the scores you see in the [Analytics Dashboards \(Beta\)](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/tools-for-improving-your-content/analytics-dashboards-beta/introduction-to-dashboards) and the [“All Content” view](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/tools-for-improving-your-content/get-a-snapshot-of-your-contents-performance) in the CMS. We are currently working to investigate and resolve this issue.

In the meanwhile, to ensure the dashboards and CMS show accurate data, the dashboards will only display data prior to Nov. 1. This means **all of the scores you’ll see are based on data from Oct. 1-31 or May-October**.
