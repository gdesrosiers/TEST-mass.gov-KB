# Legacy Redirects

## Summary

A redirect directs web traffic from one URL to another. In the Mass.gov CMS, redirects are called Legacy Redirects, since they direct visitors from our legacy URLs to one of our new URLs. To create a Redirect, you’ll need to know:

* The legacy URL \(or URLs\) you want to redirect to your new Mass.gov page
* The title of your new Mass.gov page

## How to create a redirect

1. Find Legacy Redirect in the **Add Content** menu.
2. If you don’t see Legacy Redirect**,** you might not have permission to make one. You can request permission by [submitting a ServiceNow support request](https://massgov.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0bb8e784dbec0700f132fb37bf9619fe). Depending on your author status, we might ask you to reach out to your supervisor before granting permission.
3. Copy and paste the legacy URL into the **Legacy URL** field.
4. You can send more than one legacy URL to each new page. To add another, click **Add Another Item**, and enter your second legacy URL.
5. Begin typing the name of your new page in the **Drupal Page** field. You will not be able to enter a page that is not published.
6. Notice that this field has a “o” on the right side. This means it’s an autofill field: you will be able to select your page by title. Type the first few letters of the page’s title, and then select from the list.
7. Make sure that the **Environment** field is set to **Staging and Production**.

Then, when you’re ready, publish the page. Expect 1–2 hours before you can see your redirect working.
