# Links and documents

### Summary

The Curated List lets you create a page of 1 or more lists. You can include the following on Curated Lists:

* Advisories
* Decisions
* Documents
* Executive Orders
* Forms
* Regulations
* Rules of Court
* Contact Information
* Person

This resource will help you create useful listing pages. 

Also, since working with Curated Lists often means working with documents, it might help to [be familiar with how documents function on Mass.gov](../../authoring-and-editing/documents/).

If you plan to create a staff directory or something similar, learn how you can [use the Person and contacts subtype](directory-people-and-contacts-subtype.md).

### Before you start

No matter what type of list you’re making, there are a couple of things to keep in mind before you create one in edit.mass.gov:

* You can have up to 26 lists per Curated List page. These can be a mix of automatic and manual lists \(we explain what these mean below\).
* For design and usability reasons, we don’t support including Service Details in Curated Lists. If you find yourself wanting to do this, there’s probably a better way to organize your content. We suggest you [sign up for a strategy session with the Digital Services content team](../../get-help-from-the-mass.gov-team/content-strategy-session.md) to work on your information architecture.
* You can link to Curated Lists in 2 places: the **What You Need to Know** section of a Service Page, and the **Featured Services** section of an Organization Page. Before you create a list, consider where you plan to put it and how that will help your users.

### The "Overview" tab

Use the overview to provide some context for your Curated List. Imagine a user landing on the page from a search engine. What context will they need to understand what’s on the page?

### Automatic lists

You can make 2 types of lists on a Curated List: automatic and manual. If you select “Automatic List,” you’ll be asked to enter a label:

Here’s how labels work on Mass.gov. You can add a label to any content type you can add to Curated Lists \([documents](../../authoring-and-editing/documents/), Rules of Court, Advisories, etc.\). For example, here’s what the **label** section looks like in Rules of Court:

Then, when you enter your label of choice into the **labels** section in an automatic list, every item you’ve assigned that label to will appear. This also applies to any future items you assign that label to.

You can include multiple labels in any single list.

#### **Important! Create a unique labeling system**

Your organization’s content might be similar to another organization’s content. Creating distinct, descriptive labels ensures you’re only including the content you intend to have in a specific listing page. For example, maybe your labels include your organization acronym and a note about which list\(s\) you want them to appear on.

_**Bad example: Emergency Preparedness  
Good example: DPH — Emergency Preparedness — Documents and Forms**_

#### **Label as you create and publish**

You can save time by labeling pieces of content you know will be on a list as you create them. It helps to map out your lists ahead of time.

#### **Display descriptions for each list item**

You may want each item in your list to include brief descriptions to help users understand what the item is and how they might use it.

To include descriptions in automatic lists, check the checkbox in the **description** section.

This will display whatever content you’ve entered into the **listing description** fields for each of the items on your automatic list. This might mean you need to add **listing descriptions** to your items. You can usually find this field on the first tab, beneath a **short description.** For example, here’s the **listing description** on a document:

And here’s the **listing description** for a Form Page:

### Manual Lists

Use the manual list option to build a list of content that you haven’t labeled. You’ll add items one at a time, and items can be either **documents** or **links**. You can link to any of the content types listed at the top of this resource.

**Tip: Watch out for “blocks” of content**  
You have the ability to upload multiple links or documents to manual lists at once. However, if you do upload several items at the same time, it will create a block of content. While you can reorder these blocks as a whole and the items within each block, you can’t move an individual item out of a block. If you need to order things differently, you may need to create more blocks. Keep that in mind while you upload items in case you need to have a document, then a link, then a document, etc.

**How to display descriptions for each list item**

You may want each item in your list to include brief descriptions to help users understand what the item is and how they might use it.

On a manual list, each item has a **description type** dropdown. If you choose “manually entered description,” a new field will appear so that you can create a description for the item \(320 characters at most\).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ckBf2XWYRYsU7yeEWN3SwQ.png)

You can also choose “Description from document item.” This will display whatever content you’ve entered into that item’s **listing description** field. This might mean you need to add a **listing description.** You can usually find a document or content type’s **listing description** on its first tab, beneath the **short description.** For example, here’s the **listing description** for a document**:**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7cgpJ3JWSvtE4wvFKq2fVQ.png)

**Tip: More on “blocks” of content** 

If you’ve created a block of content \(see above\) in a manual list, the dropdown will apply to everything in that block. For example, if you upload 6 documents at the same time, and choose “none” for **description type**, then none of the items will appear with descriptions.
