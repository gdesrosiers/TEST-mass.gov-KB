# People and Contacts \(directories\)

## Summary

You can create a staff directory using a Curated List subtype. This allows you to add [Contact Info](../contact-information-items.md) and [Person items](../person-items.md) to your Curated List. You can link a directory anywhere you can link a curated list.

To do this, select the Curated List content type from the “Add Content” menu and choose the People and contacts” subtype from the **List Type** dropdown.

**Note:** You’ll need published Contact Info and Person items to create your directory. Start by creating those, if you haven’t already.

### **Automatic Lists**

Just like with a regular Curated List, you can make a directory using either automatic and manual lists. Automatic lists are automatically sorted A-Z.

If you select “Automatic List,” you’ll be asked to enter a label:

After you’ve added your label\(s\), you’ll choose what information from your Contact Info or Person item will appear for users. You can choose to display some or all of the following:

* Online — Email and Link
* Phone
* Address
* Fax

**Note:** If a Person or Contact Information item doesn’t include the display information you’ve selected, the name will still appear in the directory

### Manual Lists

If you don’t want to use the label system, you can also curate a manual list of contacts. Keep in mind that if this list needs to be updated often, it’ll require a lot of manual work on your part. By comparison, an automatic list updates automatically.

As with the automatic list, after you’ve added your Contact Info or Person, you can choose what information from your Contact Info or Person item will appear for users.
