# Boards

### **Summary**

The Board is a subtype of Organization page that highlights the members of a board, commission, or committee. When you choose the “Board” subtype, you’ll see a new tab called “Boards,” where you’ll find the features that this resource covers.

**Note:** Before you begin adding board members, make sure you’ve created the right [Person](../person-items.md) items. The **Board** **Members** section of a Board page gets its information from Person items.

### "Boards" tab

#### Heading

Say what the group’s members are called: Board members, Commission members, Commissioners, etc.

#### **Featured Board Members**

There are 2 sections where you can add board members: “Featured Board Members” and “Board Members.” Images for "Featured Board Members" are larger than the others.

In each board member’s **Board Role** field, enter the board member’s role/job. The rest of the content – the image and bio – will come from a **Person** item, which you'll need to create separately.

#### Vacant positions

If a particular role is currently vacant, you can check the **Position Is Vacant** box.

You may add as many board members as you need, but by default, only the first 8 members, including the 2 featured, will appear on the Org page. Users will have the option to expand the list by clicking “Show all members.”
