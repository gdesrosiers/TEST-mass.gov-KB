# General Org Page

## Summary

You can use your Organization Page to connect readers with your Service Pages, Locations, and News and Events. You can even include [Topic Pages](../topic-pages/about-topic-pages.md) that are relevant for your audience.

Links to your Organization Page may appear:

![Example of a Organization Page ](../../.gitbook/assets/general-org_cropped_screenshot.png)

* On News items
* On Events
* In the **offered by** section on Service Pages
* Under the “websites” heading in Contact Information
* [On our A-Z listing of state organizations.](https://www.mass.gov/state-a-to-z) \(If it doesn’t, submit a ServiceNow so that we can link it.\)
* In the appropriate Topic Page under the [Your Government Topic in the main navigation](https://www.mass.gov/topics/your-government)

You can also refer to it on law library types \(Advisories, Decisions, etc.\).

## The Title/Banner and Overview tabs

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** To save a draft of an Organization Page, you’ll need to complete these fields:

* Full Name
* Banner Image
* Subtype \(General Organization, Elected Official or Board\) 
* Short Description
{% endhint %}

### Title and Short Description

The **Title** and **Short Description** are important because they shape how highly ranked your content is in search engines. Try to use plain, concrete language to describe your organization — imagine what a user might absorb in a quick scan of your content.

![Required fields under the &quot;Overview&quot; tab ](../../.gitbook/assets/general-org_create-organization_overview_screenshot.png)

### Who we serve

In this field, describe the people and stakeholders your organization serves and briefly describe how. You can summarize your key services and objectives, too.

This is not a good place to post staff biographies, extensive organization histories, or long lists of links. Keep in mind that the section appears under the heading “Who we serve,” and that’s what users will expect this section to be about.

The **Subtype** drop-down menu ****allows you to specify if your Organization Page represents a General Organization, Elected Official or a Board.

## The Featured tab \(Featured Item Mosaic\)

Use the **Featured Item Mosaic** to create a group \(or mosaic\) of 5 images that represent your organization, and that link to representative content.

Creating a mosaic involves a few steps. If you’re interested,[ see the Featured Item Mosaic section in the Knowledge Base](featured-item-mosaic.md).

## The Services Offered tab

You can link most types of pages in the **Featured Actions & Services** section. **Featured** links appear higher up the page. You can have up to 3.

You can also link as many Service Pages as you’d like in the **More Actions & Services** section. If you add more than 6, Mass.gov will automatically [generate a list page like this one](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-fish-and-game/services) for your Organization Page. Users will get to this listing page by clicking on the “See All Actions & Services” link:

## Map 

You can use the map tab to add relevant locations to your organization page. You add locations by selecting one or more Location content type items from the autocomplete field. \(To add a Location you’ll need to create it first.\) If you do not add any locations, the map won’t appear when you publish. [If you do add locations, Mass.gov will automatically generate a listing page like this one](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-registry-of-motor-vehicles/locations) for your Organization Page. Users will get to this listing page by clicking on the “Location Details” link:

###  Location details button label

Change the text that leads to your location listing from the generic “Location Details” to something more specific. 

### Location button short description

Provide a summary or context for the locations. This will appear over the listing button:

**Note:** You can also link directly to this listing in rich text, as the RMV has done here:

## News

You can tell Mass.gov to show up to 8 News articles on your Organization Page — 2 in the **Featured news item** section, and up to 6 in the **Automatic** section.

The **Featured** field offers a way to “pin” 2 news articles to your Organization page. Featured news items will appear at the top of your news feed, and they won’t change unless you remove them.

You can also set your **Automatic news items** to display 0, 3, or 6 News items. Setting your **Automatic news items** to 3 or 6 tells Mass.gov to automatically add them to your Org page according to their date. If you have more than 6 articles, the 7th \(and 8th, 9th, etc.\) will be pushed off the front of the Organization Page and [onto a listing page like this one](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/office-of-the-governor/news). Users will get to this listing page by clicking on the “See all News and Announcements” link:

## The More tab

### Featured Topics

If there’s a Topic Page in the site’s main navigation that’s especially relevant to your organization, you can add it here. This section works like all autofill sections: start typing, and select a page from the list that appears.

If you add Topic Pages, be sure to check periodically to make sure the Topic Page content hasn’t changed/is still relevant.

### Organization Grid

The **Organization Grid** has the heading “Our Organizations.” Use it to list Organizations that are officially under the official’s oversight. This **Grid** differs from the **Related Organizations** field in that **Related Organizations** might list other state entities that deal with similar subjects or services.

### Organization Parent

Use this field if you want your organization's content to appear in Mass.gov searches filtered by your parent's organization. For example, if you want your Department's content to appear in searches filtered by your Executive Office, you would add your parent Executive Office here.

**Important**: You should only enter your direct parent org into this field.
