# Location Detail

## Summary

A Location Detail page allows you to provide additional information that doesn’t fit on a Location page, or specialized or supplemental info about that Location.

Examples of uses for this content type include:

* Detailed information about hiking trails
* Jury duty information about a specific courthouse
* Historical or relevant information about a park or location

{% hint style="danger" %}
Currently, Location Detail pages can only be linked via autocomplete from the **Recommended Activities** field on park Location pages. If you’re working on a general Location page, you will have to add your Location Detail page as an inline link or a **quick action** link.
{% endhint %}

## Overview tab

### Title and Short description

The **title** and **short description** are the first things your audience sees. In fact, they might see them before they get to the page: If they’re coming from Google, the title is what will draw them to the page. It’s important that these are easy to read and use plain language.

## Sections tab

In the **Sections** tab, you’ll see options for adding a section, an iFrame, or a video:

### Adding Sections

Sections are mainly for written and image content. Each section on a Location Detail page includes a title, an optional content area, and **Additional Resources**, which can include links and downloads. You can reorder your sections by using the crosshairs in the upper left of each section to drag and drop them into a different order.

### Adding iFrames

An iFrame is a page-inside-a-page. You can think of it like the picture-in-picture option on your television: one source is “piped in” to another source. For example, MassWildlife uses an iFrame to show a report on where they’ve stocked trout, and where they’ll stock soon:

To add an iFrame to a Location Detail, you’ll need a URL from the source you want to embed in the page. This URL must be from a source that Mass.gov supports and is compatible with, such as Google docs or YouTube.[ Here’s a list of domains that you can use \(must be logged in to view\)](https://edit.mass.gov/node/105146).

#### To add an iFrame:

1. Click “Add iFrame”
2. Add your iFrame’s URL to **URL**.
3. In the **Administrative Title**, say what your iFrame shows. This will only be visible to other authors.
4. You also need to enter text in **Title for Accessibility**. To do this, imagine what a user who experiences the internet through text read aloud would need to understand what the iFrame shows.[ Learn more about iFrames and accessibility.](https://webaim.org/techniques/frames/)​
5. Enter a **Height**. Often, you will need to save a draft, review it, and adjust the **height**. Trial-and-error is the best method for picking the right **height**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your content is large or involves user interaction, it might be better to link directly to it. There are limits to how responsive iFrames are.
{% endhint %}

If you have questions about iFrames, please [submit a support request through ServiceNow](https://massgov.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0bb8e784dbec0700f132fb37bf9619fe).

### **Adding Videos**

You can also add videos that are hosted on YouTube or Vimeo to your Location Detail.

1. Click **Add Video**
2. Click **Add new file** or **Add existing file**
3. Give your video a title in **Media Name**
4. Paste the URL of your video into **Video URL**
5. If you add content into **Transcript and Video Description**, Mass.gov will create a link to a page with your video and this content
