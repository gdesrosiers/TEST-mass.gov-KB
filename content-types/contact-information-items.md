# Contact Information items

### Summary

When you author Contact Information on Mass.gov, you’re creating a chunk of information that you can add to these content types:

* Advisory
* Decision
* Event
* Form
* How-to
* Location
* Organization
* Regulation
* Service Detail
* Curated List \(when you’re making a directory\)

When you update your Contact Information, every page that includes that information will update, too.

**Important:** While working in the CMS, you will be able to author or edit a Contact Information “page” that is only visible to Mass.gov authors. However, this “page” is only for internal use: regular visitors will get an an error if they click on links to it. Be careful never to link to Contact Information, either inline or in link fields, except in fields called **Contacts**.

### **AP style**

**Mass.gov adheres to AP style guidelines**. For Contact Information content, this means:

* Abbreviate “Street,” “Avenue,” and “Boulevard,” but spell out everything else.
* For example: 200 North Road but 200 North St.
* Phone number formatting: \(XXX\) XXX-XXXX

### **Display and administrative title**

The **display title** is what appears on the page. The **administrative title** is to help authors distinguish between contacts that use the same display title. For example, if you have 2 **display titles** that read “Department of Technology Services,” you could give them different **administrative** names so that you could tell them apart while in “editor” mode. Note: The admin title won’t be displayed to the public.

### **The hours field**

If possible, you should use the **typical hours** field, even though it means selecting each day and time individually. This will help keep formatting uniform across Mass.gov, which contributes to a better user experience.

### **Labels**

Use the **Label\(s\)** field if you plan on using this Contact Information to build an [automatic list for a directory](../mass.gov-style/why-redirects-are-important.md).

#### **Important! Create a unique labeling system**

Your organization’s content might be similar to another organization’s content. Creating distinct, descriptive labels ensures you’re only including the content you intend to have in a specific listing page. For example, maybe your labels include your organization acronym and a note about which list\(s\) you want them to appear on.
