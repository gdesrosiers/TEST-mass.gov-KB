# Service Page

## Summary

This resource will help you navigate the Service Page content type. The Service Page is a hub for the details and transactions that make up a program, service, or process. It plays an important role across Mass.gov, and sometimes you’ll need to do some planning before making one:

* [Learn how to identify your services](../mass.gov-style/tips-for-identifying-services.md)
* [Strategize about how to reach the right audience](../mass.gov-style/writing-for-your-mass.gov-audience.md)
* [Sign up for a content strategy session with the Digital Services team](../get-help-from-the-mass.gov-team/content-strategy-session.md)

Examples of services include:

* [DHCD’s Emergency Housing Assistance Program](https://www.mass.gov/emergency-housing-assistance-programs), which helps users find emergency shelter and learn about housing funding programs.
* [RMV’s Motorcycle Licenses](https://www.mass.gov/motorcycle-class-m-drivers-licenses), where users can apply for a license, permit, or schedule a road test.
* [DUA’s Unemployment Insurance \(UI\) Online](https://www.mass.gov/unemployment-insurance-ui-online), which includes information, help, and links stakeholders to the UI application.

### **Required fields**

To save a draft of a Service Page, you will need to add something to these fields/sections:

* **Service name**
* **Short description**
* **Banner image** \(for desktop displays\)
* **Overview**

## **The Banner and Overview tabs**

### Title and short description

The **title** and **short description** are the first thing your audience sees. In fact, they might see them before they get to the page: If they’re coming from Google, the title is what will draw them in. Service Page **titles** and **short description**s also appear on Mass.gov’s Topic Pages. Try to write them using the words you think your audience would enter into a search engine to find them.

### Overview

A good **overview** tells readers what the service is and what its linked pages let them do. Here are 2 ways to think about what makes a good overview:

* [Write what users can do, as on this Unemployment Benefits for Workers Service Page](https://www.mass.gov/unemployment-benefits-for-workers).
* [Summarize what users can do on the pages linked to the Service Page, as on Freshwater Fishing Information](https://www.mass.gov/freshwater-fishing-information).

### First time guide, Eligibility Information, and Contact Info

These fields are for users who don’t have much background knowledge. The **First time guide** field allows you to link Guides, which you can use as introductions or instruction manuals for your service. In **Eligibility Information,** link Service Details that explain who your service is meant for.

You can tell users how to contact you in different ways. You can enter a Contact Information item in the **Contact Information** field, or you can enter an Organization Page into the **Offered by** field. \(You can also include both.\) In deciding what’s right for your service, ask yourself what you want users to do. For example, if you want to encourage them to interact with your organization online, leave the **Contact Information** field blank.

In some cases, it will be better to enter Contact Information on How-tos, Service Details, and Location Details, and to leave that section of your Service Page blank.

## Tasks and key info tab

Service Pages offer 2 types of information: what you can do and what you need to know. When you work on this section, it can help to think about what the user will see:

### **The "What would you like to do?" section**

This section’s title implies that its links will help users do something. There are 2 sets of links: **Featured** **tasks** and **All tasks**. **Featured** links appear higher up the page, and they also appear on Topic Pages. \(They’re the blue boxes on the gray cards.\) You can link most types of pages in **Featured**.

The **All tasks** section should list links to How-to pages, or pages that help users do something. If you add more than 6 pages here, the CMS will [generate a “see all” listing like this one](https://www.mass.gov/rental-assistance-programs/tasks).

### **The "What you need to know" section**

This section’s title tells users that this is where they can find information. The pages here should be Service Details, Information Details, Curated Lists, Guides, Binders, or Forms. If you add more than 6 pages here, the CMS will [generate a “see all” listing like this one](https://www.mass.gov/early-education-and-child-care-programs-and-agencies/need-to-know).

**Important:** Don’t link other Service Pages in either section, as this creates a confusing user experience. If you want to link this service to other services, you can add those in **Related Services**.

## The Map and Additional info tabs

### **Map**

You can use the **map** tab to add relevant locations to your service. To do this, first create a Location content type, and then add it here. If you do not add any locations, the map won’t display when you publish. If you do add locations, Mass.gov [will generate a listing page like this one](https://www.mass.gov/visit-massachusetts-state-parks/locations) for your Service Page. Users will get to this listing page by clicking on the Location Details link:

### Location details button label

Change the text that leads to your location listing from the generic “Location Details” to something more specific.

### Location button short description

Provide a summary or context for the locations. This will appear over the listing button:

## **Additional info**

The **Related Services** and **Additional Resources** fields are good for useful, but not crucial, information. As a reminder, don’t link to [Contact Information](contact-information-items.md) here, as regular visitors won’t be able to view it.
