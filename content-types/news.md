# News

## Summary

News items on Mass.gov can take the following forms:

* Speech
* News \(article\)
* Press Release
* Press Statement

To save a draft of a News item, you’ll need to fill out/make a selection in the following sections:

* **Title**
* **Announcement Type**
* **Publish Date**
* **Signees** \(you will need to include at least 1 state organization\)

Press Statements and Releases also require

* **Media contact** \(you’ll enter [a Person item you created earlier](person-items.md)\)

Once you’ve published your News item, it will appear on your[ Organization Page\(s\) ](organization-pages/)as long as you didn’t select “none” in your Org Page’s **Automatic news item** section. That is, you have to set your Org Page to automatically display news in order for News items to appear on it.

## The Overview tab

### Title, announcement type, and short description

Think of the **Title** as a headline. Include keywords that will help your content stand out in searches \(from Google, for example\).

Picking an **Announcement type** changes the “eyebrow” in the page’s upper left corner. Whatever you select will appear there:

### **Short Description**

The **short description** appears beneath the **title**. Think of it like a subtitle— a sentence that summarizes the essence of the article. Remember not to simply repeat your News item’s title. Often, the best short description is a 1-sentence summary of your News item. It will appear, along with the beginning of your News item, in social media previews:

## The Signees tab

You’ll need to list at least one state organization, though you can list as many state or external organizations as you’d like. The **Related Organization** field is an autofill field, which means you’ll start typing the name of the organization you’re looking for and select it from the list. The names on this list read according to what the [organization has titled its Organization Page.](organization-pages/)

![News items can have more than 1 signee.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FwNadq99B2ImQvHbeE0VmA.jpeg)

Signee information will appear at the bottom of the page. Users will see the organization’s name, short description, and logo. These are determined by content on the Org Page you’ve selected. You can also choose to upload a different image.

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you get permission to list others’ organizations as signees. When you list a **state organization**, you’re also telling Mass.gov to add your News item to that organization’s Org Page. \(It won’t appear if that Organization’s **Automatic news item** section is set to “none”\).

## News on your Org page

Here’s how News appears on an Org page. The top items are **featured**, meaning an author chose them. Those on the bottom are **automatic**, meaning they appear automatically according to their date and the organization being a signee:

## Main Content

### **Location**

Whatever you type in the **location** field will be formatted as a dateline: displayed in all caps followed by an em dash. So, Boston would display as BOSTON —

### **Adding a video**

To add videos that are hosted on YouTube:

1. Click “Add Video.”
2. Click “Add new file” \(“Add existing file” does not work yet\).
3. Give your video a title in **Media Name**.
4. Paste the URL of your video into **Video URL**.
5. If you add content into **Transcript and Video Description,** Mass.gov will create a link to a page with your video and this content.

### **Using multiple sections**

Each section on a News item includes a \(required\) title, an optional content area, and Additional Resources, which can include links and downloads. Since the content area is optional, you could begin your News item with downloads. You would skip the overview, create a section with a title and downloads, and then create a new section with your content. You can reorder your sections by using the crosshairs at the left of each section to drag and drop them into a different order.

Adding sections to your News item can also help you stay organized. You could do all your authoring in the Overview section using the rich text editor’s formatting tools. However, sometimes it’s helpful to start a new section so that it’s easier for you to navigate your own content.

## **Media Contact\(s\)**

If you’re creating a Press Release or Statement, you’ll also need to add a **media contact** for members of the press to access. The **media contact** will be a Person that you’ve already created. The **media contact** will display on the right, and in an accordion at the bottom of your News.
