# Binders

### Summary

The Binder ties related pages together. It includes a table of contents and other navigational tools that encourage users to read content in an order you set. Use a Binder to create long form reports, chapter books, or collections of content on a similar theme.

You can include these content types in a Binder:

* Advisories
* Decisions
* Rules of Court
* Regulations
* Executive Orders
* [Information Detail](information-details.md)

You can also include downloads in the Binder’s **appendix**.

To save a draft of a Binder, you’ll need to:

* Create a **title**
* Pick a Binder **type**
* Create a **short description**
* List at least 1 **organization.**
* Fill in the **Date Published.**
* The best place to connect a Binder is the **What you need to know** section of a Service Page. You can also add it to the Service Page’s **Featured Tasks.**

If your organization creates a lot Binders, you could also add them to a [manual list in a Curated List](curated-lists/). Please note that Binders will not appear in a manual list’s autocomplete field. You’ll need to copy and paste each Binder’s URL into a **List item’s** URL field.

### The “Overview” tab: Your Binder’s cover page and table of contents

Binders create connections among your content. When you make a Binder, you’ll want to prepare users for what the collection as a whole is about. Think of the Binder as a cover page for the content it contains.

As with other content types, write the **title** and **short description** using language you think your audience would use. It’s also a good idea to Google your intended title to see if it’s identical to existing Mass.gov content.

You’ll need to pick a Binder **type.** Currently, you can choose from 5**:** Archive, audit, handbook, law library, or report. Whatever you pick will appear as an “eyebrow” above the title:

If none of these reflects the content you want to include in a Binder, [request a new one from the Mass.gov team through ServiceNow](https://massgov.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0bb8e784dbec0700f132fb37bf9619fe).

You’ll need to fill in at least one Organization Page in the **Organization\(s\)** field. Whatever you select will appear above your entries for the **Date Published** and **Last Updated** fields. Here’s how this content will appear for users:

### Pick your content

You can add content to a Binder either 1 page at a time or in groups. This choice shapes the Binder’s table of contents. For example, if you use the **Add Page** option, your page will receive its own entry in the table of contents. If you use the **Add group** option, you’ll create a chunk of pages that live under a subtitle — the group **Name.** This subtitle then appears as an expandable option in your Binder’s table of content:

The Binder can also include downloads in the **appendix**:

### How Binders help users navigate content

When users are reading through a Binder, its pages will have special navigation tools. At the top of each page in a Binder is an expandable table of contents:

![Collapsed table of content](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*UXau3LmthRqPzA2b.)

![Expanded table of contents](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*7RWo4uFSQ8an7UVE.)

At the bottom of the Binder, users will find a link to the next page and to the Binder’s cover page.

There’s one situation where these tools won’t appear. If you add a page to multiple binders, and users find that page through search \(e.g. a search engine or the Mass.gov search\), the navigational tools won’t appear. However, if users find the same page from a Binder cover page, that Binder’s navigational tools will appear.
