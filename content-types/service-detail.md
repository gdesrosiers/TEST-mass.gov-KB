# Service Details

## Summary

The Service Details offer concise, simple information about the Service it’s linked to. They’re made for short, simple content. If you’re writing about something complicated, you might to use an [Information Details page](information-details.md).

Here are some examples of content you might use a Service Details for:

* To explain who qualifies for unemployment benefits
* To give information about how to take a road test so users can get a driver’s license
* To show where in the state you’ve been stocking rainbow trout
* To describe what your organization looks for in grant proposals

## **Overview tab**

### **Title and Short description**

The **title** and **short description** are the first thing your audience sees. In fact, they might see them before they get to the page: If they’re coming from Google, the title is what will draw them to the page. Service Details titles might also appear in the **Eligibility Information** or **What you need to know** sections of a Service Page. It’s important that these are easy to read and use plain language.

### **Overview**

The **Overview** on a Service Details page is optional. You can use this field to introduce your content, or you can start with the “Add section” button under the **Sections** tab.

If you do use the **Overview** field, that content will not have a header. If you choose to begin by adding a section, your content will begin with the title of that section as a header.

### Organization\(s\)

You’ll find the **Organization\(s\)** field at the bottom of the first tab in every Mass.gov content type, and in documents. This field tells [Mass.gov’s search](../mass.gov-style/how-search-works/constituent-centered-search.md#organization-s) which pages belong to which organization.

This field also powers the "Offered by" relationship indicator \(the small green rectangle\(s\) in the upper left corner\) on each Mass.gov page. Making sure yours is right will help users who land on your content find their way to your Organization Page.

## Sections tab

In the **Sections** tab, you’ll see options for adding an iFrame, a section, or a video:

### **Adding iFrames**

An iFrame is a page-inside-a-page. You can think of it like the picture-in-picture option on your television: one source is “piped in” to another source. For example, MassWildlife uses an iFrame to show a report on where they’ve stocked trout, and where they’ll stock soon:

To add an iFrame to a Service Details, you’ll need a URL from the source you want to embed in the page. This URL must be from a source that Mass.gov supports and is compatible with, such as Google docs or YouTube. [Here’s a list of domains that you can use \(must be logged in to view\)](https://edit.mass.gov/node/105146).

{% hint style="info" %}
Consider using an Information Details Page for large iFrames or in cases where you want an iFrame to be the main feature of your page. 
{% endhint %}

To add an iFrame:

1. Click “Add iFrame”
2. Add your iFrame’s URL to **URL.**
3. In the **Administrative Title,** say what your iFrame shows. This will only be visible to other authors.
4. You also need to enter text in **Title for Accessibility.** To do this, imagine what a user who experiences the internet through text read aloud would need to understand what the iFrame shows. [Learn more about iFrames and accessibility.](https://webaim.org/techniques/frames/)
5. Enter a **Height.** Often, you will need to save a draft, review it, and adjust the **height.** Trial-and-error is the best method for picking the right **height**.

Additionally, you should always try out your iFramed page on a cell phone or tablet to get a sense of the user experience. You may learn that an iFrame is not a good solution, especially if lots of your traffic comes from mobile.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** If your content is large or involves user interaction, it might be better to link directly to it. There are limits to how responsive iFrames are.
{% endhint %}

If you have questions about iFrames, please submit a support request through [ServiceNow](https://www.mass.gov/servicenow).

### **Adding Sections**

Sections are mainly for written and image content. Each section on a Service Details page includes a title, an optional content area, and **Additional Resources**, which can include links and downloads. Since the content area is optional, you could begin your Service Details with downloads. You would skip the overview, create a section with a title and downloads, and then create a new section with your content. You can reorder your sections by using the crosshairs in the upper left of each section to drag and drop them into a different order.

Adding sections to your Service Details page can also help you stay organized. You could do all your authoring in the **Overview** section using the rich text editor’s formatting tools. However, sometimes it’s helpful to start a new section so that it’s easier for you to navigate your own content.

### **Adding Videos**

You can add videos that are hosted on YouTube or Vimeo to your Service Details.

To add a new video:

1. Click "Add video"
2. Click “Add new file”
3. Fill in **Name** to title your video
4. Paste the URL of your video into **Video URL**
5. If you add content into **Transcript and Video Description**, Mass.gov will create a link to a page with your video and its transcript and description

To add a video that you've uploaded in the past:

1. Click "Add existing file"
2. Enter the title or part of the title in **Media name contains**
3. Check the box to the left of the correct video 
4. Click "Select video"

## **Related tab**

In the related tab, you'll see options for adding contact information and links related to your Service Details Page.

### **Contact**

In the **Contact** field you can add a [Contact Information](contact-information-items.md) or [Person](person-items.md) item that people can contact for more information about your service. Enter the name of the Contact or Person item and it will automatically populate in the field's dropdown menu.

### **Related Links**

In the **Related Links** fields, you may link up to 5 pages that visitors to your content might also be looking for. To link existing Mass.gov pages, enter the title of the page and it will automatically populate in the field's dropdown menu.  


![](../.gitbook/assets/service-detail_related-links%20%281%29.png)

If you're linking to an external web page, past the URL into the **URL** field and fill in the **Link text** to inform visitors where the link will take them.
