# Person items

### Summary

When you create a Person on Mass.gov, you’re creating a chunk of information that you can add to other content types, such as:

* [Boards ](organization-pages/boards-organization-subtype.md)or [Elected Official](organization-pages/elected-official-organization-subtype.md) subtypes of Organization pages
* **Media Contact** field on [News items ](news.md)\(news, speech, press release, and press statements\)
* People and contacts subtype of [Curated Lists \(also called a directory\)](curated-lists/directory-people-and-contacts-subtype.md)

**Important:** Only link to a Person in the above fields or content types. If you link to a Person item in any other field, users won’t be able to access it.

When you update a Person, every piece of content it’s attached to will update, too.

### Using the Person as a Board Member for a Boards subtype of Organization Page

You’ll create this version of a Person to add information to a Boards-type Organization Page.

#### **Media image**

This optional image will be displayed on the Boards subtype of Organization Pages. This image must be exactly 172 x 228 pixels \(px\).

This image will display at full size when you add a Person to the “Featured Board Members” section of the Boards page. A slightly smaller version will display \(72 x 96 px\) if you add it to the “Board Members” section.

#### **Role/Title**

This field is for the person’s secondary title \(in addition to their role on a board\). An example of when you would use this field is if the person holds an official title in state government, such as “secretary” or “governor.”

Don’t add their board role here — you’ll do that on the Org Page. This will display as an “eyebrow” above the individual’s name.

#### **Short Bio**

You can add an optional short description about the board member’s duties or general background. This will display on Boards-type Organization Pages after you add this Person:

{% page-ref page="organization-pages/boards-organization-subtype.md" %}

### Using the Person with the Elected Official subtype of Organization Page

#### **Profile Image**

This optional image will be displayed on the Elected Official subtype of Organization Pages. The size of this image should be 235 x 235 px.

#### **Bio page**

To create a biography page, you’ll need to create or update a Person item. Find and check the checkbox at the bottom of your Person:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LHvmMkf3byOijsI2)

This will create a new tab called “Bio Page” where you can add bio content for the official, including:

* A main content area for biographical info, achievements, etc.
* Social media links
* A high-resolution image

Note: The image that appears on the Elected Official Page is the one you add to the Profile Image field, which is located in the “Overview” tab.

{% page-ref page="organization-pages/elected-official-organization-subtype.md" %}

### The Organization field

This field is an “autofill” field. It will accept the name of an already-published organization page. As with all autofill fields, type the first few letters of an organization page’s title, and then select the correct organization from the list that appears.

### Labels

Use the **Label\(s\)** field if you plan on using this Contact Information to build an automatic list for a [directory](curated-lists/directory-people-and-contacts-subtype.md).

#### **Important! Create a unique labeling system**

Your organization’s content might be similar to another organization’s content. Creating distinct, descriptive labels ensures you’re only including the content you intend to have in a specific listing page. For example, maybe your labels include your organization acronym and a note about which list\(s\) you want them to appear on.

### AP style

**Mass.gov adheres to AP style guidelines**:

* Phone number formatting: \(XXX\) XXX-XXXX
