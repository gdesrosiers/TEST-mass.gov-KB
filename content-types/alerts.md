# Alerts

### Summary

You can create page-level Alerts to tell your users important, time-sensitive information, such as that a location is closed, or that the application linked from your Service page is down for maintenance.

You can post page-level Alerts to **ALL** Mass.gov content types **except**:

* Contact Information
* Fees
* Legacy Redirects

We highly recommend not using Alerts for advisories, news, or nonessential content. It’s also a good idea to [set an unpublish date for alerts](../authoring-and-editing/schedule-publishing-and-unpublishing.md) so that they don’t remain after they’re no longer relevant.

Also, keep in mind that many users access Mass.gov on phones. Creating Alerts substantially affects their reading experience, since their screens are small enough that Alert banners might take up 2 or even 3 lines. Only post Alerts when you really need to.

### Overview tab

You can create two types of Alerts on Mass.gov: Emergency and informational. Emergency Alerts include “Alert!” in small caps before your message:

Informational Alerts include “Notice”:

### **Alert placement**

This section lets you tell Mass.gov which pages you want your Alert to appear on. You can add as many Mass.gov pages as you’d like.

### Alert message

You have lots of options for creating content in the Alerts content type. However, not all of that content will appear on the page\(s\) you post your Alert to. Here’s what visitors to those pages will see:

* The “Alert!” or “Notice” tag
* Anything you enter into the **Content** field

Note: Keep what you write in the **Content** field short. Large modern screens fit about 120 characters, but small screens will “wrap” your message \(so that it takes up multiple lines\).

For example, here's what an Alert looks like on a desktop...

...and here's the same Alert on mobile:

### **Full-page Alert displays**

If you fill out the **Link** field, your Alert content will become a link to whatever page you’ve chosen. If you don’t fill out the **Link** field, your Alert will become a link to your Alert’s full-page display.

The Alert’s full-page display will include:

* The **Alert headline**
* **Content**
* **Timestamp**

You may also add the following \(optional\) items:

* More content, using the **rich text** field
* iFrames and Videos
* Contact Information
* Related links

You can move **rich text, iFrames,** and **videos** up or down using the crosshairs in the upper left:

### Adding more than 1 Alert message

Any additional Alert messages you add will appear beneath the first:

Again, keep users with small screens in mind. Stacks of Alert messages will make your pages harder to read.

### Scheduled unpublishing

It’s a good idea to schedule your alert for unpublishing so that it disappears when it’s no longer relevant.

You’ll find a dropdown called scheduling options in the gray box on the right side of the editing interface. This lets you schedule when Alerts go live and expire. [More on using the schedule options feature here.](../authoring-and-editing/schedule-publishing-and-unpublishing.md)
