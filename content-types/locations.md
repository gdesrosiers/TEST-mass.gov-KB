# Locations

## Summary

Location pages help constituents know where to find you, how to get there, and what they can \(or can’t\) do once they arrive. Each Location page features an interactive map, so potential visitors can see where your location is and easily get directions from Google Maps, whether on a desktop or mobile device.

Location pages are linked from either an [Organization page](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/content-types/organization-pages/general-org-page#map) or [Service page](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/content-types/service-page#the-map-and-additional-info-tabs). Once you’ve created your Location page\(s\), you’ll be able to add them to an Organization or Service page via the “Map” tab.

If you add more than 1 Location page, Mass.gov will automatically generate a Location Listing page. A map featuring “pins” for each location will display at the bottom of your Organization or Service page. If you click the button on the left of the map, you’ll be taken to the Location Listing page.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Since the purpose of a Location page is to provide information about where to go, how to get there, and other methods of contact make sure you’ve created a [Contact Information item](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/content-types/contact-information-items) with an address and hours of operation **before** creating your Location page.
{% endhint %}

To save a draft of a Location page, you’ll need to fill out/make a selection in the following sections:

* Title
* Location type
* Primary Location
* Banner image
* Organization\(s\)
* Parking

## “Header” tab

### Title, Location subtitle, and Location type

The **title** should be a clear and complete name for the location. Try to keep it short and free of abbreviations when possible. Only use acronyms if they’re well-known to the public \(ex. RMV\).

Add a **location subtitle** to define the location \(ex. “Region 5,” “Cash or check only,” or “Limited services”\). This optional field will only appear on a Location Listing page.

You can choose from 2 **location types**, general or park. If you’re not creating a page about a state park, you will choose “general.”

### Location Icons, Primary Location, and Banner image

**Primary location** features the primary address and contact information for your location. This means you will need to have first created a Contact Information item before creating your Location page. Only Contact Information with an address and hours of operation can be used.

You can easily note certain features offered by your location by selecting **location icons**. These icons will appear on the Location page, while the accessible icon will also display on the Location Listing page.

For general locations, you can choose:

* Transit friendly
* Accessible

For park locations, you can choose the 2 icons above, plus:

* Dogs Allowed
* Historic Site

Your **banner image** should visually prepare visitors for what to expect once they arrive. For general locations, please provide a photo of the exterior front of the location or building. If you’re creating a park location, please provide a picture that is both attractive and represents the features of the park. The orientation of the image should be horizontal, and it should be at least 800 x 400 pixels.

## “Required Details” tab

### Overview and Parking

A good **overview** tells people what they can do or what to expect when they visit your location. These should be brief, typically 2-5 sentences.

You’ll need to provide details about **parking**. If there’s no parking available, please say that or list alternatives.

## “Optional Details” tab

### Facilities, Services, Accessibility, Restrictions, More info, and Related locations

The sections on this tab allow you to share a little more about what visitors can do \(or can’t do\) when at your location.

{% hint style="info" %}
Parks locations will include 2 additional fields: **Recommended Activities** and **All Activities**.
{% endhint %}

Highlight **related locations** to let people know what’s nearby or what other locations provide similar features or services. These will appear on the bottom of general locations as “Related Locations” and at the bottom of parks locations as “Related Parks.”

## “Related” tab

### Quick Actions and Additional Contacts

Provide up to 3 links where a user can perform an action online or download a helpful pdf related to the in-person experience. These links will appear as **quick action** buttons at the top of the page.

You can add **additional contacts** to your Location page, such as a separate department based at the same location, alternate entrances, or seasonal offices. Again, you’ll need to have first created a Contact Information item before adding it here.
