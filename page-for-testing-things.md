## Question: Why don’t inline links get captured in the Pages Linking Here tool?

Response: This tool can only track links made using the autofill fields in the CMS. Using these fields creates a dynamic connection in Drupal that can be tracked, which we use to keep page titles updated, links from breaking, and in calculating the scores of the pages, as well as list pages in this section.

## Question: Why do we need additional layers before getting to information?

Response: While the website has a specific architecture, a user might land anywhere on Mass.gov, from a search engine. If you’ve built your information clearly and used the best keywords, they will most likely land on exactly the page they want. But, for those who start on the homepage or an Org page, the site architecture is designed to create buckets of related information so it’s easy for someone to navigate to what they need.. The links between these layers also create connections that help boost search engine results and deliver the most relevant pages to users there.

## Question: How do I contact authors? What if I can’t find out who the author is?

Response: We have a KB article for this - [Contacting authors within the CMS](https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/authoring-and-editing/contacting-authors-within-the-cms). You can also submit a request through ServiceNow if you’re unable to reach the author through the CMS.

## Question: What are the best practices for converting content types?

Response: Use Pages Linking Here to update all pages that link to your old content before moving it to the trash. Also, once you have moved it to the trash, be sure to request a Drupal to Drupal redirect through ServiceNow.
