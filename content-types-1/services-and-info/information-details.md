# Information Details

## Summary

The Information Detail is designed for long, complex content. You’ll be able to add more images, media, and customization than on other content types. It also supports long form content with a table of contents.

Since the Mass.gov CMS offers several long form content types, it might help to understand how Information Details fit in.

* If your content takes users through a complex, interrelated process, use a[ Guide](guides.md)
* If you need to create a list of something, use a [Curated List](curated-lists/)
* If you need to quickly explain who is eligible for your service, use a [Service Detail](service-detail.md). If eligibility is complicated, use an [Information Detail](information-details.md).
* If you want to include full width images or iFrames use an[ Information Detail](information-details.md)
* If you need to publish research or a long form explanation of a single subject, use an [Information Detail](information-details.md)
* You might also want to combine multiple Information Details into a [Binder](binders.md), where you can encourage users to read them in a specific order

To save a draft of your Information Details, you’ll need:

* A **title**
* A **short description**
* At least 1 content **section** \(**note:** The table of contents will only appear if you have at least 3 sections\).

The best place to link Information Details are:

* In the **What you need to know section** or **Eligibility Information** sections of a Service Page
* In a Binder
* In a Curated List

## Header media: Adding iFrames, Images, or Videos

The Information Detail offers more media options than other Mass.gov content types.

Your header can include an image, iFrame, or a video — but only one at a time. To switch from one header media type to another, click the “remove” button, and then the “confirm removal” button.

### **Adding images**

If you choose an image for your **Header media** option, it will display at 1600 pixels wide. This is the same width as the Organization Page’s banner. Please note that the display will adapt to the height of your image — there’s currently no limit. A good place to begin might be 1600 x 400 pixels.

### **Adding iFrames**

An iFrame is a page-inside-a-page. You can think of it like the picture-in-picture option on your television: One source is “piped in” to another source.

On an Information Detail, iFrames will display at full-width. By contrast, iFrames on a Service Detail stop short of the right side of the page to make room for Contact Information and related links. If you need to use an iFrame to add a large data visualization or map to your content, the Information Detail might be a good choice. Here’s what an iFrame looks like on an Information Detail:

To add an iFrame to your Information Detail, you’ll need a URL from the source you want to embed in the page. This URL must be from a source that Mass.gov supports and is compatible with, such as Google docs or YouTube. [Here’s a list of domains that you can use](https://edit.mass.gov/node/105146) \(must be logged in to view\).

To add an iFrame:

1. Click “Add iFrame”
2. Add your iFrame’s URL to **URL**
3. In the **Administrative Title**, say what your iFrame shows. This will only be visible to other authors.
4. You also need to enter text in **Title for Accessibility.** To do this, imagine what a user who experiences the internet through text read aloud would need to understand what the iFrame shows. [Learn more about iFrames and accessibility.](https://webaim.org/techniques/frames/)
5. Enter a **Height.** Often, you will need to save a draft, review it, and adjust the height. Trial-and-error is the best method for picking the right height.

**Important:** If the content you want users to access is large or requires a great deal of interaction, it is sometimes better to link directly to it. There are limits to how responsive iFrames can be.

Additionally, you should always try out your iFramed page on a mobile device to get a sense of the user’s experience. You may learn that an iFrame is not a good solution, especially if lots of your traffic comes from mobile devices.

### **Adding Videos**

You can also add videos that are hosted on YouTube to your Information Detail pages.

1. Click “Add Video”
2. Click “Add new file” \(“Add existing file” does not work yet\)
3. Give your video a title in **Media Name**
4. Paste the URL of your video into **Video URL**
5. If you add content into **Transcript** and **Video Description**, Mass.gov will create a link that to a page with your video and this content

## Sections

Your Information Detail will include one or more sections. Beginning with the third section, each new section will be listed in the Information Detail’s table of contents. \(This works the same as with Guides and Curated Lists work.\)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*aMB9DM7zJ_qidxSU.)

Within each section, you’ll have several tools to help you present your content. This might feel familiar from authoring Service Details, though you’ll have more options here:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-xM5M7beYTR8qvGnP4KFBQ.png)

You can add an image, a video, or an iFrame using the same steps described above.

You can also add a rich text section — or a block of formatted text.

The other 2 options are the “pull quote” and the “stat.” Pull quotes “pull out” a section of text to emphasize it. You’ve probably seen this in news writing. Pull quotes underscore the point of your content, and they help visually break up long sections of text.

Stats also callout important information and allow you to visually break up content. When you add a stat, you’ll be given the option to align it right or left. Your main content will then wrap around the stat:

## **How users will use the table of contents**

Information Details have “sticky” tables of contents — or tables of contents that come along for the ride when a user scrolls.

As the users scrolls past the table of contents at the top, the table collapses:

However, users can click the blue “Table of Contents” button to see a list of all the Information Detail’s headings:

## Managing and moving blocks of content

You might find that you need to move sections or chunks of content around. Use the crosshairs in the upper left to drag and drop chunks of content:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dcRqx8BTJ-gpvT326qnRoA.png)

Once you’ve created enough sections, it might become unwieldy and awkward to move content using the crosshairs. You can click the “Show row weights” button at the top right of the “Sections” tab. Then, change the number in the mid-right of a content block to indicate how high up the page you want it. The smaller the number, the higher up the block will go. For example, 0 comes before 1, and -1 comes before 0.
