# Labels

## **Summary**

Rather than add items one by one to a [Curated List](), you can save time by using labels to automate the process. When you enter your label of choice into the **Label\(s\)** section in a Curated Listâ€™s [automatic list](), every item youâ€™ve assigned that label to will appear. This also applies to any future items you assign that label to.

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

## **Adding labels to your content**

You can add labels to any content type that can be added to a Curated List. This includes:

* [Documents]()
* [Binders]()
* [Information Details]()
* [Contact Information]()
* [Person Items]()
* [Forms]()
* Advisories
* Decisions
* Regulations
* Executive Orders
* Rules of Court

Youâ€™ll add your unique labels to the **Label\(s\)** field at the bottom of the Overview tab.

### **Label as you create and publish**

You can save time by labeling pieces of content you know will be on a list as you create them. It helps to map out your lists ahead of time.

## **Important! Create a unique labeling system**

Your organizationâ€™s content might be similar to another organizationâ€™s content. Creating distinct, descriptive labels ensures youâ€™re only including the content you intend to have in a specific listing page. For example, maybe your labels include your organization acronym and a note about which list\(s\) you want them to appear on.
