# How documents work

## **Summary**

Authors should be able to create something once and reuse it in multiple places. Instead of updating the document on each page, you should only need to do it once, and your document will be up-to-date wherever it lives on the website. In some places, this works great today. In other places, it’s a work in progress, and you’ll probably need to do some manual work.

To understand documents on Mass.gov, it helps to learn the difference between a “file” and a “media entity,” since you’ll be working with both.

**File** means what you think it means: A Microsoft Word document or a .pdf, for example.

A **media entity** is a container for a file and for the information associated with that file. \(This associated information is called “metadata,” and it helps makes documents easier to find for content managers and constituents.\) When you add a download, you’re linking your content to the media entity.

You can edit the data contained in a media entity just as you can edit a content type. On the “All documents” menu, click “edit” to open a media entity in edit mode:

Once you’ve opened the media entity, you can change the data it contains, such as its title and the organization it is associated with. You can also change the file it contains:

Replacing the file inside the media entity will cause the file to update anywhere you’ve linked to the media entity on Mass.gov.

## **Creating a document**

You can add a new document to edit.mass.gov in multiple ways. However, keep in mind that documents your organization had on Percussion should already be migrated to the new CMS, so you might not need to add a new version of the file. \(See below for more information on Percussion migrations.\)

**Using the admin toolbar**  
You can add a document to the system via the admin toolbar. At the top of the page, click the “+Add Document” button. This toolbar is also where you can select "+Add Content" to create new pieces of content on edit.mass.gov.

**Using the “All Documents” tab**  
You can also use the “All Documents” tab under the “Content” menu.

### Listing description

Every document has a **listing description** field. Use this field to briefly describe the document for users — why they might need it, for example. [When you add documents to Curated Lists, you can click a box to make sure this description appears along with your document.](../../content-types-1/services-and-info/curated-lists/#automatic-lists)
