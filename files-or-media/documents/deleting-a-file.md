# Deleting a file

## Summary

You can permanently delete a file by replacing it within its media entity. \(Reminder: [Documents are made up of _files_ inside _media entities_](how-documents-work.md#summary)_._\)

There are 2 ways to remove a file:

### Replace the file \(useful if you have a more up-to-date version\)

1. Find the document in the “All Documents” menu.
2. Click the “edit” button on the right.
3. Scroll to the **file** field.
4. Replace the file. You’ll see a pop-up message confirming the file will be removed.
5. Scroll to the bottom and click save.

### Unpublish the document

1. Find the document in the “All Documents” menu.
2. Select the document by checking the box to the left of the document.
3. Select  “Unpublish media” from the **Action** drop-down menu
4. Click the "Apply to Selected Items" button under the **Action** drop-down menu.

**Note 1**: Some files might still be suffering from an earlier bug in which they’re not published, but users can still get to them. To fix this, “edit” the document, make sure “published” is not checked, and click save.

**Note 2**: If you remove a file make sure you use Pages Linking Here to ensure it’s not linked to any content.
